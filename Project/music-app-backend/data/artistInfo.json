        "biography": "Maude Latour is fulfilling her pop destiny.  Maude is Dutch-American and born in Sweden, but raised in London, Hong Kong, and New York City. She now resides in Los Angeles.  Latour began writing songs and at 15 while attending high school in New York. She released her first EP, Starsick, in 2019, and went on to receive a degree in philosophy at Columbia University. Maude explains that songwriting is the medium of her unending philosophical inquiry.  Her &#34;dorm room&#34; pop music turned coming of age existentialism has defined her cinematic universe as cosmic, experimental, and &#34;main-character&#34;. Her ever-evolving catalog includes the viral lockdown-era hit “One More Weekend” plus four infectious EPs, which have won over critics from The New York Times to NPR, and earned performances at Lollapalooza, Governors Ball, Austin City Limits, and many more. Now, with her new debut album Sugar Water, the 24 year-old is doubling down on her formula of combining studio experimentation with undeniable cosmic-pop hooks and thoughtful lyrics, inviting her audience to come along for the ride, eyes and mind wide open, and stereo turned up as far as it can go.",

        "biography": "Inspired by Dua’s own self-discovery, Radical Optimism (out May 3) is the third album from 3x GRAMMY and 7x BRIT Award-winning pop powerhouse Dua Lipa. Radical Optimism taps into the pure joy and happiness of having clarity in situations that once seemed impossible to face. The hard goodbyes and vulnerable beginnings that previously threatened to crush your soul, become milestones as you choose optimism and start to move with grace through the chaos. Rolling Stone has called the album “pop bliss,” while noting it is “uniquely and utterly Dua Lipa: confident dance pop full of witty Instagram-caption-ready one-liners.”\n\nRadical Optimism follows Dua&#39; sophomore album Future Nostalgia, which solidified her position as both a critical and commercial success. The GRAMMY-winning record was the longest running top 10 album by a female artist on the Billboard 200 in 2021 and spawned multiple worldwide hit singles, with “Levitating” earning certified diamond status and the title of Billboard’s No. 1 Hot 100 Song of 2021.\n\nDua’s eponymous 2017 debut album is certified platinum, spawned six platinum tracks, and made her the first female artist in BRIT Awards history to pick up five nominations in a single year. Dua has 10 GRAMMY nominations with three wins. Globally, she has amassed over 40 billion streams across platforms and has the top two most streamed albums by a female artist of all time on Spotify.",

She has amassed an outstanding 110 million global album sales, 175 billion streams, and 758 million song consumption units, making her one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Her most recent pop album, Chromatica, became her sixth consecutive #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, making her the first female artist to achieve this over a ten-year period (2011-2020). Gaga&#39;s collaboration with Ariana Grande on “Rain On Me” had the biggest Spotify debut of 2020, reaching #1 on the Global and US Spotify Charts. In 2023, her debut single “Just Dance” became her third diamond-certified single by the RIAA, joining &#34;Bad Romance&#34; and &#34;Poker Face.&#34; In 2018, she won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for “Shallow,” featured on the soundtrack of Best Picture nominee A Star is Born (2018), in addition to claiming a Golden Globe, a Critics’ Choice Award, and four GRAMMYs for both “Shallow” and “I’ll Never Love Again,” also from the same soundtrack. Lady Gaga knows no bounds, from producing her classic pop hits to exploring the classic American Songbook with her albums Cheek to Cheek and Love For Sale with Tony Bennett, both #1 albums. Beyond music, she excels in business as the founder of Haus Labs and thrives as an actress (A Star Is Born, House of Gucci, Joker: Folie à Deux), as well as a passionate activist for mental health and LGBTQ&#43; rights through her Born This Way Foundation.",

Born in Uppsala, Sweden, Bornlöf started to hone his craft at an early age. He was banging a drum set before he could talk and with musical talent running through the family, his older brother started giving him piano lessons at the age of eleven. After graduating from high school, he confined himself to the parameters of his home studio - located in the scenic central Swedish community of Dala-Järna - determined to master his craft. With unwavering devotion he kept at it, buying equipment, writing songs and producing local artists, gradually building the solid foundation on which his success lay. In 2012, he joined Epidemic Sound and his unique sense of melody and quality of tone runs like a common thread through all of his projects. Listening to his extensive body of work, one is struck by the ease with which he shifts between different styles. With several of his tracks breaking the 20 million stream mark on Spotify, Johannes Bornlöf is living proof that hard work pays off.\n\nJohannes&#39; other projects &amp; artist names across different genres and styles: <a href=\"spotify:artist:05aWuDQP5PwWhJEEsGNqYp\" data-name=\"Yi Nantiro\">Yi Nantiro</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3z6E6ZPwJ7l0mp3HHcOfd2\" data-name=\"Bonnie Grace\">Bonnie Grace</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2KeSLpd8bmBZmHtcIOdVGL\" data-name=\"Jo Wandrini\">Jo Wandrini</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5nn0v7ZNnO4cY7TEAjjfSx\" data-name=\"Edgar Hopp\">Edgar Hopp</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6Ga6q3KSIGpJt2H1vbtTI0\" data-name=\"Dream Cave\">Dream Cave</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7jU9KNOUS9FqDvHCUiRqZN\" data-name=\"Adriel Fair\">Adriel Fair</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5cTbiMgshgMqKk35tOMrmg\" data-name=\"Francis Wells\">Francis Wells</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4TnpyhaWuBeLesVYjr9TbI\" data-name=\"Mary Riddle\">Mary Riddle</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:14elbOcXjl043MKBKQuGPS\" data-name=\"David Celeste\">David Celeste</a>.",

Deep romantic love, breathy lust, generous self-love—and their opposites, self-loathing, resentment, disappointment—all make appearances on One Million Love Songs, Bnny’s revelatory second album.\n\nBnny’s debut, Everything, was written in the face of tragedy, following the death of Viscius’ partner, fellow Chicago musician Trey Gruber. It was a raw, honest album whose songs seemed to emanate from Viscius like a personal climate. Pitchfork called Everything “a beautiful record from wall to wall, comfort food for heartbroken insomniacs.” And while those songs have not lost an ounce of their power, performing them every night live across the US and Europe made for a new and different kind of exhaustion. It’s hard to access your grief all the time; it’s even harder to share it. “I wanted to make songs that are exciting to play—songs that make me feel happy,” Viscius says. “This album is about love after loss, getting older, and just trying to have fun with a broken heart.”\n\nOne Million Love Songs was recorded in Asheville at Drop of Sun and produced by Viscius alongside Alex Farrar (Wednesday, Indigo De Souza, Snail Mail).",

        "biography": "Along with bringing trap to the masses as one-third of <a href=\"spotify:artist:6oMuImdp5ZcFhWP0ESe6mG\">Migos</a>, rapper/producer Quavo brings his triplet flows and personalized style to his solo releases and a multitude of other artists' tracks as a featured guest. His 2018 solo album Quavo Huncho rose to the number two spot on the Billboard charts, and he appeared as a guest on several songs that did time in the Top Ten, including hits from <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1uNFoZAHBGtllmzznpCI3s\">Justin Bieber</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:246dkjvS1zLTtiykXe5h60\">Post Malone</a>. Quavo frequently releases new material in the form of non-album singles, and in 2022, he teamed with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6oMuImdp5ZcFhWP0ESe6mG\">Migos</a> affiliate <a href=\"spotify:artist:3EW0kQ1skZiK1NHg3Spt9J\">Takeoff</a> for a joint album, Only Built for Infinity Links, which also cracked the Top Ten. Shortly after the release, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3EW0kQ1skZiK1NHg3Spt9J\">Takeoff</a> was shot and killed, and Quavo dedicated his 2023 sophomore album Rocket Power to his departed collaborator. Rocket Power also rose to the higher reaches of the Billboard charts, debuting within the Top 20. The following year saw a number of collaborations including the charting hit \"Tough\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:00FQb4jTyendYWaN8pK0wa\">Lana Del Rey</a>.\r\n\nQuavo was born <a href=\"spotify:artist:2azpbTOpkfvphCbc4AZqFJ\">Quavious Marshall</a> in 1991 and grew up in Lawrenceville, Georgia. Alongside <a href=\"spotify:artist:4DdkRBBYG6Yk9Ka8tdJ9BW\">Offset</a> (his cousin) and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3EW0kQ1skZiK1NHg3Spt9J\">Takeoff</a> (his nephew), he helped form <a href=\"spotify:artist:6oMuImdp5ZcFhWP0ESe6mG\">Migos</a> in 2009 and they released their first mixtapes, Juug Season in 2011 and No Label in 2012. (No Label went on to receive a sequel in 2014.) However, it wasn't until the release of the track \"Versace\" from their 2013 mixtape, Young Rich N*ggas, that they came to full prominence. The song was a breakout hit, receiving further exposure when <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> produced a remix. In 2014, Quavo was named \"most influential rapper\" by the online hip-hop community Complex Music. In subsequent years, he appeared on further releases with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6oMuImdp5ZcFhWP0ESe6mG\">Migos</a>, most notably their full-length albums Yung Rich Nation (2015) and C U L T U R E (2017). He also appeared on tracks like \"Champions\" for <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>'s GOOD Music label and performed alongside <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a> on 2016's \"Fuck Cancer,\" and on 2017's \"Go Off\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY\">Travis Scott</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4O15NlyKLIASxsJ0PrXPfz\">Lil Uzi Vert</a> for the Fate of the Furious movie soundtrack. Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, a collaborative project with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY\">Travis Scott</a>, was also released in 2017. The following year, Quavo released a series of solo singles, including \"Workin Me\" and \"Bubble Gum.\" Those tracks found their way onto his official solo debut, Quavo Huncho, which arrived in October 2018. The album featured guests such as <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY\">Travis Scott</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0fA0VVWsXO9YnASrzqfmYu\">Kid Cudi</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4DdkRBBYG6Yk9Ka8tdJ9BW\">Offset</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3EW0kQ1skZiK1NHg3Spt9J\">Takeoff</a>, and even <a href=\"spotify:artist:6tbjWDEIzxoDsBA1FuhfPW\">Madonna</a>. Quavo continued adding flare to other artists' singles with featured verses over the next few years, appearing on tracks by <a href=\"spotify:artist:3crnzLy8R4lVwaigKEOz7V\">E-40</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4Gso3d4CscCijv0lmajZWs\">Don Toliver</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5yG7ZAZafVaAlMTeBybKAL\">Iggy Azalea</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:738wLrAtLtCtFOLvQBXOXp\">Major Lazer</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:17lzZA2AlOHwCwFALHttmp\">2 Chainz</a>, and many others. In 2018, Quavo was featured on <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QHgL1lAIqAw0HtD7YldmP\">DJ Khaled</a>'s \"No Brainer,\" which peaked at number five on the charts, and in 2020 he was featured on another track that hit that mark with his contributions to <a href=\"spotify:artist:1uNFoZAHBGtllmzznpCI3s\">Justin Bieber</a>'s single \"Intentions.\" He also issued several singles of his own, including the 2021 song \"Strub tha Ground,\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:1eEWyJrV7yRZiuBFTUTzfk\">Yung Miami</a>. In May of 2022, Quavo teamed up with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3EW0kQ1skZiK1NHg3Spt9J\">Takeoff</a>, Unc, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7mTJBVGJmkgbjwvbzc0Bqb\">Phew</a> on \"Hotel Lobby,\" the first single to precede the joint Quavo/<a href=\"spotify:artist:3EW0kQ1skZiK1NHg3Spt9J\">Takeoff</a> studio album Only Built for Infinity Links. The album was released in October of that year and featured a who's-who of guest stars including <a href=\"spotify:artist:57LYzLEk2LcFghVwuWbcuS\">Summer Walker</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:13y7CgLHjMVRMDqxdx0Xdo\">Gucci Mane</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hlmm7s2ICUX0LVIhVFlZQ\">Gunna</a>, and more. Only Built for Infinity Links debuted at number seven position on the Billboard Top 200 chart. On November 1, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3EW0kQ1skZiK1NHg3Spt9J\">Takeoff</a> was shot and killed outside of a Houston club following a private party. Quavo was witness to his nephew's shooting, though he was uninjured. Throughout the front half of 2023, he focused his attention on a barrage of non-album solo singles, like \"Baby\" and \"Honey Bun\" before teaming up with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a> for \"Turn Yo Clic Up.\" In August of 2023, Quavo released his second studio set, Rocket Power, which was dedicated to <a href=\"spotify:artist:3EW0kQ1skZiK1NHg3Spt9J\">Takeoff</a> and featured verses from him on multiple tracks. It also included contributions from <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>, BabyDrill, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:508weSx4HBumrGggFmc7br\">Hunxho</a>, with production from <a href=\"spotify:artist:3CbYyyd8wH3RT6t0jwpdzC\">Murda Beatz</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1rHOtdmGNr5vcYNw5v7QGC\">Kenny Beats</a>, Bnyx, and many others. Rocket Power (the title of the album itself is a reference to <a href=\"spotify:artist:3EW0kQ1skZiK1NHg3Spt9J\">Takeoff</a>) debuted at the number 18 position on the Billboard charts. A pair of collaborations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7jAs1uPnpfNmT6e5qtEPxq\">ATL Jacob</a> and BU$HI kicked off 2024, followed by the solo track \"Himothy.\" In March, Quavo teamed up with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1pPmIToKXyGdsCF6LmqLmI\">Rich the Kid</a> for \"Real One.\" More eclectic collaborations followed, including the charting hit \"Tough\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:00FQb4jTyendYWaN8pK0wa\">Lana Del Rey</a>, \"Fly\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5gznATMVO85ZcLTkE9ULU7\">Lenny Kravitz</a>, and \"Georgia Ways\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0BvkDsjIUla7X0k6CSWh1I\">Luke Bryan</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:33qOK5uJ8AR2xuQQAhHump\">Teddy Swims</a>. ~ Rob Wacey, Rovi",

        "biography": "Tyler, The Creator is a rapper and producer distinguished above all other singular qualities by his gravelly voice and an irascible disposition befitting a collision-shop owner. He appeared in the late 2000s as a founding member of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5xpkLC1MxiPRiIJUDEzuVm\">Odd Future</a>, an outlandish teenaged alternative rap crew that gradually permeated the mainstream as it begat a multitude of related projects. Most of these recordings, including <a href=\"spotify:artist:3A5tHz1SfngyOZM2gItYKu\">Earl Sweatshirt</a>'s Earl, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5xpkLC1MxiPRiIJUDEzuVm\">Odd Future</a>'s Top Ten The OF Tape, Vol. 2, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2h93pZq0e7k5yf4dywlkpM\">Frank Ocean</a>'s Grammy-winning Channel Orange, were made with Tyler's deep involvement. Amid this whirlwind, Tyler started building a solo discography that has gleefully swung from purposefully distasteful and crude to charming and sophisticated, sometimes blurring the distinction between the extremes. Goblin (2011), Wolf (2013), Cherry Bomb (2015), and Flower Boy (2017), his first four solo albums, all debuted within the Top Five of the Billboard 200. The widespread embrace of the kaleidoscopic Flower Boy, a number two hit nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Rap Album, led to chart-topping, Grammy-winning success with IGOR (2019) and CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST (2021). The latter lengthened Tyler's stylistic reach while reaffirming his devotion to hip-hop with a raw lyrical approach.\r\n\nTyler Okonma was born and raised in Los Angeles County, splitting time in Ladera Heights and nearby Hawthorne. He got his first taste of fame when the Los Angeles Times ran a \"teen on the street\"-type story on the then-16-year-old skateboarding enthusiast, who was also interested in music and fashion. Around this time, Tyler began making music with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5xpkLC1MxiPRiIJUDEzuVm\">Odd Future</a>'s other core members, and in 2009 released a solo mixtape titled Bastard. By the end of the following year, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5xpkLC1MxiPRiIJUDEzuVm\">OF</a>'s surreal and filthy material, epitomized by <a href=\"spotify:artist:3A5tHz1SfngyOZM2gItYKu\">Earl Sweatshirt</a>'s mixtape Earl -- most of which Tyler produced -- had earned them a loyal following. It was during that year that a video Tyler directed for the <a href=\"spotify:artist:5xpkLC1MxiPRiIJUDEzuVm\">OF</a> track \"French\" took off, topping a million views by December and drawing attention to a slew of additional crew-related mixtapes that followed.\r\n\nSigned as a solo artist to a one-album deal with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22XL+Recordings%22\">XL Recordings</a>, Tyler made his proper solo debut with Goblin. Upon its May 2011 arrival, the album became the first <a href=\"spotify:artist:5xpkLC1MxiPRiIJUDEzuVm\">Odd Future</a>-related product to be released through the traditional music-industry channels, and debuted at number five on the Billboard 200. Meanwhile, Tyler continued to produce for <a href=\"spotify:artist:5xpkLC1MxiPRiIJUDEzuVm\">OF</a> and its affiliates, most notably on The OF Tape, Vol. 2 and a later 2012 release, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2h93pZq0e7k5yf4dywlkpM\">Frank Ocean</a>'s Channel Orange, which won a Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Tyler's second LP, Wolf, followed on the <a href=\"spotify:artist:5xpkLC1MxiPRiIJUDEzuVm\">Odd Future</a> label in April 2013. It entered the Billboard 200 at number three with an expansive list of guests -- including <a href=\"spotify:artist:7IfculRW2WXyzNQ8djX8WX\">Erykah Badu</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Rj0tDHoX7C5NFq5DKIpHt\">Stereolab</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:5s8mrbpjYHWIuGYUzNTpEb\">Laetitia Sadier</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3GhVFlFT3pagjVkslQPqoJ\">Quadron</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:4cc6PmIfhsUCGJUU9QsxEy\">Coco O</a> -- reflective of Tyler's aesthetic.\r\n\nTyler's third proper album, Cherry Bomb, another <a href=\"spotify:artist:5xpkLC1MxiPRiIJUDEzuVm\">Odd Future</a> label offering, leaked to online streaming services before its official April 2015 release date. It nonetheless became the artist's third consecutive Top Ten entry, enhanced with uncredited guest appearances from <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>. Tyler's number of productions and guest appearances subsequently continued to increase through collaborations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2h93pZq0e7k5yf4dywlkpM\">Ocean</a>, fellow <a href=\"spotify:artist:5xpkLC1MxiPRiIJUDEzuVm\">OF</a> associates <a href=\"spotify:artist:7GN9PivdemQRKjDt4z5Zv8\">the Internet</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vHBuUxrcpn1do5UaEJ7g6\">Domo Genesis</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7yO4IdJjCEPz7YgZMe25iS\">A$AP Mob</a>. Flower Boy, his acclaimed fourth solo album, was issued through <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Columbia%22\">Columbia</a> in July 2017. The LP landed at number two on the Billboard 200 and was later nominated for Best Rap Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. \r\n\nThe following year, Tyler released a small batch of non-album singles, as well as the EP-length and unsurprisingly animated Music Inspired by Illumination & Dr. Seuss' the Grinch. The proper follow-up to Flower Boy, the thoroughly heartsick IGOR, arrived in May 2019. It debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one and earned Tyler a Grammy for Best Rap Album. Collaborations in 2020 with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0ABk515kENDyATUdpCKVfW\">Westside Gunn</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y4inQK6OespitzD6ijMwb\">Freddie Gibbs</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6icQOAFXDZKsumw3YXyusw\">Lil Yachty</a> set the stage for his sixth solo LP. CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST, hosted by Gangsta Grillz mixtape don <a href=\"spotify:artist:5oNgAs7j5XcBMzWv3HAnHG\">DJ Drama</a>, offered some of Tyler's toughest beats and rhymes while incorporating synth pop and reggae deviations. Issued in June 2021, the album put Tyler back on top of the Billboard 200 and spawned the Hot 100 hit \"WusYaName,\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:7wlFDEWiM5OoIAt8RSli8b\">YoungBoy Never Broke Again</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7c0XG5cIJTrrAgEC3ULPiq\">Ty Dolla $ign</a>. It also made Tyler a repeat Grammy winner of Best Rap Album. CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST: The Estate Sale, an expanded version of the album featuring eight additional tracks, appeared in 2023. Tyler broke his 2-year release pattern in 2024 with the critically-acclaimed Chromakopia: delving into themes of ageing and fatherhood, the rapper's varied set featured hidden features from the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4E2rKHVDssGJm2SCDOMMJB\">Doechii</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5IcR3N7QB1j6KBL8eImZ8m\">ScHoolboy Q</a>. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi",

Since forming in 2017, the group has crafted a flurry of effervescent tunes imbued with pop, rock, and hip-hop elements. Their delivery takes inspiration from the frantic energy of the city streets around them and the infinite possibilities of youth. \n\nThe debut album Summer Jam dropped to warm reviews in 2018 before the runaway success of “Wave Alpha”—a collaboration with idiosyncratic Saigonese rapper Cam—skyrocketed their popularity with a new generation of Vietnamese desperate for fresh sounds. The boys have been riding the wave ever since, and the release of their adventurous CHÁI MÁI EP alongside hit anthems “No Internet” and “Yêu” further propelled the band toward mainstream stardom. \n\nIn recent times, the group has dropped “Đừng Yêu Người Nổi Tiếng,” “Trốn Tìm,” and “DOPAMINE,” a series of singles hinting at a more diverse and expansive sound while retaining the vitality of their early work. Those trademark hooks and sun-drenched melodies remain, and fans can expect even more variety from the self-titled new album, coming late summer 2024.",

Having burst upon the worldwide scene with 2018’s Don’t’ Waste Your Time EP and its 2019 follow up LP, Mana, UNTO OTHERS set the metal underground ablaze, leading to a clutch of high-profile gigs and tours with the likes of King Diamond, Uncle Acid and The Deadbeats, and Paradise Lost in the US &#43; Europe with Gaahl’s Wyrd and Tribulation. Hundreds of live shows across the world have solidified UNTO OTHERS’ position on the rock and metal landscape as black clad, dark sunglass wearing successors to the likes of Sisters of Mercy and Type O Negative. On inking with Century Media and hiring British producer Tom Dalgety (Ghost, The Cult), what began as an exaltation of exhaustion from endless time on the road, blossomed into the band’s most diverse and fulfilled work to date. \n \n\n\nNever, Neverland builds upon the seductive and beguiling foundation UNTO OTHERS has hewn out of a bedrock of goth, classic rock, punk, black metal and heavy metal.  From propulsive opener, “Butterfly” to the majestic “Angel of the Night” all the way through to the wry, punkish swagger of “Suicide Today” and their unforgettable take on The Ramone’s “Pet Sematary”, Never, Neverland is equally dreamy while never letting go of the energy and darkness that is UNTO OTHERS.",

Raised in Brooklyn, he took to classic reggae and dub at a young age and started studying jazz seriously at age 17. Playing keys with various ska and reggae bands throughout his college days at SUNY Purchase, after graduation he joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:3YjjyECs8VfNCx5vMXUERf\">Cooly's Hot Box</a> and then filled a keyboard spot in <a href=\"spotify:artist:4hBVFGsIXxdtc7d5JeM5jd\">Special Request</a> until 1996. In 1998, he released his first solo album, Polydemic, using the <a href=\"spotify:artist:65TvRagqHkewAv1kKIaAcl\">Ticklah</a> alias. Around the same time he became one of the original members of <a href=\"spotify:artist:59O57msePcyTge2k7MzmlT\">Sharon Jones</a>' <a href=\"spotify:artist:6LufpoVlIYKQCu9Gjpk8B7\">Dap-Kings</a>, and he joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:2KGF6IKZfVGCKfyqcNVGfh\">Antibalas</a> the following year. As he became well-known as one of the more versatile multi-instrumentalists on the scene, he started becoming more involved in studio production in Don't Trip, his Gowanus sidewalk studio, and collaborated with Michael G. in <a href=\"spotify:artist:5FWTu1MZdB5fjKif2rZldJ\">the Easy Star All-Stars</a> while masterminding Roots Combination, another aliased solo project. As he worked on his own creations in his free time, he also concocted remixes with <a href=\"spotify:artist:44E0JWHttieVoD6vUHWoa2\">DJ Spinna</a>, recorded <a href=\"spotify:artist:32WK2OuP2PG4r7sH7bUfN9\">Ronny Jordan</a>, and produced <a href=\"spotify:artist:0isKHAkxWOxFgxplUBZY04\">Dr. Israel</a>'s Inna City Pressure. Session work with producer <a href=\"spotify:artist:3hv9jJF3adDNsBSIQDqcjp\">Mark Ronson</a> led to his appearance on tracks with big-time British artists <a href=\"spotify:artist:13saZpZnCDWOI9D4IJhp1f\">Lily Allen</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2HcwFjNelS49kFbfvMxQYw\">Robbie Williams</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6Q192DXotxtaysaqNPy5yR\">Amy Winehouse</a>, including playing on \"Rehab.\" In 2007 he attempted to spread himself thicker and focused exclusively on <a href=\"spotify:artist:65TvRagqHkewAv1kKIaAcl\">Ticklah</a>, before releasing Ticklah vs. Axelrod in September. ~ Jason Lymangrover, Rovi",

        "biography": "Kolohe Kai has consistently been one of the most popular artists in Pacific Island Reggae music for over a decade. The project of singer/songwriter Roman De Peralta, born and raised on the island of Oahu, has produced 10 Island Reggae hits since signing a record deal at age 17. His sound infuses the localism of ukulele music with rhythms of roots reggae, and more recently pop and r&amp;b—pushing Kolohe Kai into an elevated tier of Island Reggae.\n\nEarly Kolohe Kai was deeply influenced by the island reggae legends of the past, which can be heard on debut album This Is The Life (2009). But recently Kolohe Kai has expanded the pop influence through collaborations with renowned Grammy Award-winning producer Brian Kierulf on singles like “Catching Lightning” and “Heartstrings.” There’s a maturity to Kolohe Kai after years of being viewed as the “Justin Bieber of Hawaii.” Still the roots reggae influence will always be present in Kolohe Kai.\n\nThe popularity is undeniable as Kolohe Kai has been one of Hawaii’s #1 most streamed reggae artist of the past decade with over 40 million streams in 2020 alone. Kolohe Kai’s album Paradise (2013) was named Reggae Album of the Year by Na Hoku Hano Hano Awards, which is the Grammys equivalent in Hawaii. His 2019 record Summer To Winter won Reggae Album of the Year at the Island Music Awards, largely due to the success of the single “Round and Round” which became the graduation song of 10 Hawaiian high schools that year.",

        "biography": "Apart from being one of the best-selling artists in music history, Eminem is one of the greatest rappers of his generation. He's effortlessly fast, fluid, dexterous, and unpredictable, capable of pulling off long-form narratives or withering asides. And thanks to his mentor <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a>, he's had music to match with thick, muscular loops evoking the terror and paranoia conjured by his lyrics. To be certain, a great deal of the controversy Eminem courted came through in how his violent fantasias, often directed at his mother or his wife, intertwined with flights of absurdity that appealed to listeners too young to absorb the psychodramas explored on his breakthrough albums The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem's commercial peak came around the time of his 2002 album The Eminem Show (which went platinum 27 times over) and with his crossover onto the big screen that same year with 8 Mile, a film that earned him acclaim for his performance and an Oscar for the film's anthem, \"Lose Yourself.\" Eminem's journey as a living rap legend included struggles with addiction, near-constant feuding with other artists, and a celebrity status that shifted as the years went on. Through all his various changes, however, he continued growing as an artist as well as consistently hitting high commercial marks. Though critics could be unkind to efforts like 2009's Relapse or 2017's Revival, fans made sure that each new album sold at least platinum numbers and topped the charts. Instead of recycling old ideas, the rapper experimented with new production approaches, faster flows, and increasingly complex multisyllabic wordplay on projects like 2020's Music to Be Murdered By and the 2024 concept album The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), in which he confronted and killed his alter ego.\r\n\nBorn Marshall Mathers in the Kansas City, Missouri suburb of St. Joseph, Eminem spent his childhood between Missouri and Michigan, settling in Detroit in his teens. At the age of 14, he began rapping with a high school friend, the two adopting the names \"Manix\" and \"M&M,\" which soon morphed into Eminem. Under this name, Mathers entered battle rapping, a struggle dramatized in the fictionalized 8 Mile. Initially, the predominantly Black audience didn't embrace him, but soon his skills earned him a reputation, and he was recruited to join several rap groups. The first of these was the New Jacks, and after they disbanded, he joined Soul Intent, who released a single in 1995. This track also featured <a href=\"spotify:artist:1W7G3vXPeISR3Oi9ggVfyE\">Proof</a>, and the two rappers broke off on their own to form <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Qi4Bb7a8C0a00NZcA77L0\">D-12</a>, a six-member crew that functioned more as a <a href=\"spotify:artist:34EP7KEpOjXcM2TCat1ISk\">Wu-Tang</a>-styled collective than a regularly performing group. \r\n\nAs he was struggling to establish his career, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim had a daughter, Hailey, forcing him to spend less time rapping and more time providing for his family. He assembled his first album, Infinite, which received some underground attention in 1996, not all of it positive. After its release, Eminem developed his Slim Shady alter ego, a persona that freed him to dig deep into his dark id, something he needed as he faced a number of personal upheavals, beginning with a bad split with Kim, which led him to move in with his mother and increase his use of drugs and alcohol, capped off by an unsuccessful suicide attempt. All this sturm und drang was channeled into The Slim Shady EP, which is where he first demonstrated many of the quirks that became his trademark, including his twitchy, nasal rhyming and disturbingly violent imagery. \r\n\nThe Slim Shady EP opened many doors, the most notable being a contract with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Interscope+Records%22\">Interscope Records</a>. After Eminem came in second at the 1997 Rap Olympics MC Battle in Los Angeles, <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Interscope%22\">Interscope</a> head Jimmy Iovine sought him out, giving the EP to <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a>, who proved eager to work with Eminem. They quickly cut Em's <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Interscope%22\">Interscope</a> debut in the fall of 1998 -- during which time Marshall reconciled with Kim and married her -- and The Slim Shady LP appeared early in 1999, preceded by the single \"My Name Is.\" Both were instant blockbusters and Eminem became a lightning rod for attention, earning praise and disdain for his violent, satirical fantasias. \r\n\nHe quickly followed The Slim Shady LP with The Marshall Mathers LP in the summer of 2000. By this point, there was little doubt that Eminem was one of the biggest stars in pop music: the album sold almost two million copies within the first two weeks of release, but Mathers felt compelled to tweak other celebrities, provoking pop stars in his lyrics, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4xtWjIlVuZwTCeqVAsgEXy\">Insane Clown Posse</a>'s entourage in person, providing endless fodder for the tabloids. This gossip blended with growing criticism about his violent and homophobic lyrics, and under this fire, he reunited his old crew, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Qi4Bb7a8C0a00NZcA77L0\">D-12</a>, releasing an album in 2001, then touring with the group.\r\n\nDuring this furor, he had his biggest hit in the form of the moody ballad \"Stan.\" Performed at the Grammys as a duet with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b\">Elton John</a>, thereby undercutting some accusations of homophobia, the song helped Eminem cross over to a middlebrow audience, setting the stage for the ultimate crossover of 2001's 8 Mile. Directed by Curtis Hanson, best known as the Oscar-nominated director of L.A. Confidential, the gritty drama fictionalized Eminem's pre-fame Detroit days and earned considerable praise, culminating in one of his biggest hits with the theme \"Lose Yourself,\" which won Mathers an Oscar. \r\n\nAfter all this, he retreated from the spotlight to record his third album, The Eminem Show. Preceded by the single \"Without Me,\" it turned into another huge hit, albeit not quite as strong as its predecessor, and there were some criticisms suggesting that Eminem wasn't expanding his horizons much. Encore, released late in 2004, did reach into more mature territory, notably on the anti-<a href=\"spotify:artist:2JZbcOAw67koOHlFTjMeGX\">George W. Bush</a> \"Mosh,\" but most of the controversy generated by the album was for behind-the-scenes events: a bus crash followed by canceled dates and a stint in rehab. Rumors of retirement flew, and the 2005 appearance of Curtain Call: The Hits did nothing to dampen them, nor did the turmoil of 2006, a year that saw Mathers remarrying and divorcing Kim within a matter of four months, as well as the shooting death of <a href=\"spotify:artist:1W7G3vXPeISR3Oi9ggVfyE\">Proof</a> at a Detroit club.\r\n\nDuring all this, Em did some minor studio work, but he soon dropped off the radar completely, retreating to his Detroit home. He popped up here and there, most notably debuting the hip-hop channel Shade 45 for Sirius Satellite Radio in September 2008, but it wasn't until early 2009 that he mounted a comeback with Relapse, an album whose very title alluded to some of Mathers' struggles with prescription drugs, but it also announced that after an extended absence, Slim Shady was back. While not quite a blockbuster, the album went platinum, and Eminem followed it at the end of the year with an expanded version of Relapse (dubbed Relapse: Refill) that added outtakes and new recordings. Recovery, initially titled Relapse 2, was issued in June 2010. The album debuted on top of the Billboard 200 chart, where it remained for five consecutive weeks, while its leadoff single, \"Not Afraid,\" debuted on top of the magazine's Hot 100 singles chart.\r\n\nThe year 2010 also brought Eminem back together with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DVipHzYsPlIoA0DW8Gmns\">Royce da 5'9\"</a> under the <a href=\"spotify:artist:77IURH5NC56Jn09QHi76is\">Bad Meets Evil</a> moniker. In turn, June 2011's Hell: The Sequel marked the release of their first EP as a duo (barring the previous month's release of key EP track \"Fastlane\" as a single) and was their first batch of new material since a 1999 double A-side. After an intense period of recording, Eminem announced in August 2013 that his next solo album would be a nostalgically themed set of new material entitled The Marshall Mathers LP 2, which landed in early November. The album featured the singles \"Berzerk,\" \"Rap God,\" and \"Survival,\" plus the chart-topping hit \"The Monster\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a>. In 2014, new tracks landed on the double-disc set Shady XV, which celebrated the <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Shady%22\">Shady</a> label's 15th birthday. The singles \"Phenomenal\" and \"Kings Never Die\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:4yiQZ8tQPux8cPriYMWUFP\">Gwen Stefani</a> arrived a year later, both taken from the Southpaw soundtrack. \r\n\nEminem resurfaced in October 2017 with a freestyle anti-Trump rap, which didn't appear on Revival, the December 2017 album that was filled with cameos, including appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m\">Beyoncé</a> (\"Walk on Water\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:6eUKZXaKkcviH0Ku9w2n3V\">Ed Sheeran</a> (\"River\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1KCSPY1glIKqW2TotWuXOR\">P!nk</a> (\"Need Me\"). His seventh straight chart-topper, it ultimately failed to match the sales heights of past efforts, despite the international success of the \"River\" single. The next year, without warning, Eminem issued his surprise tenth album, Kamikaze. The set featured appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:6C1ohJrd5VydigQtaGy5Wa\">Joyner Lucas</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DVipHzYsPlIoA0DW8Gmns\">Royce da 5'9\"</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3KedxarmBCyFBevnqQHy3P\">Jessie Reyez</a>, as well as \"Venom,\" from the film of the same name. In January 2020, he repeated this surprise-release approach with 11th studio album Music to Be Murdered By. The album featured production from <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a> and cameos from the now-usual host of special guests, this time featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:3ZotbHeyVQKxQCPDJuQ4SU\">Q-Tip</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6eUKZXaKkcviH0Ku9w2n3V\">Ed Sheeran</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3jK9MiCrA42lLAdMGUZpwa\">Anderson .Paak</a>, and the late <a href=\"spotify:artist:4MCBfE4596Uoi2O4DtmEMz\">Juice Wrld</a>, among many others. The set debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and was re-released in expanded form in December under the title Music to Be Murdered By: Side B. In 2021, Eminem appeared on the <a href=\"spotify:artist:4utLUGcTvOJFr6aqIJtYWV\">Skylar Grey</a> song \"Last One Standing\" along with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6AgTAQt8XS6jRWi4sX7w49\">Polo G</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4AA474G2hRfrHyGrfyDseO\">Mozzy</a>. The track was featured on the soundtrack for the film Venom: Let There Be Carnage and cracked the Top 100 of the Billboard charts. 2021 also saw Eminem opening a spaghetti restaurant in Detroit, named Mom's Spaghetti after a line from \"Lose Yourself.\" \r\n\nIn February 2022, he performed alongside <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1XkoF8ryArs86LZvFOkbyr\">Mary J. Blige</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>, and others at the half-time show of Super Bowl LVI. That June, Eminem released \"The King and I,\" a track he recorded with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5nLYd9ST4Cnwy6NHaCxbj8\">CeeLo Green</a> for the soundtrack of <a href=\"spotify:artist:7HhTERkBV4Ot14KphgBfSh\">Baz Luhrmann</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:43ZHCT0cAZBISjO8DG9PnE\">Elvis Presley</a> biopic, Elvis. \"The King and I\" was one of three new songs on Curtain Call 2, a 2022 compilation covering the singles Eminem had released since Curtain Call: The Hits. \"From the D to the LBC,\" a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG\">Snoop Dogg</a>, was also featured on Curtain Call 2. \r\n\nIn June of 2024, Eminem released his 12th studio LP The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce). The album largely centered around the concept of Marshall Mathers being kidnapped by his alter ego Slim Shady and fighting internally between these two sides of his personality. The album included production work from <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6GEykX11lQqp92UVOQQCC7\">DJ Premier</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5CiGnKThu5ctn9pBxv7DGa\">Benny Blanco</a>, as well as rap cameos from <a href=\"spotify:artist:0c173mlxpT3dSFRgMO8XPh\">Big Sean</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0sKsReKseslDlhxmbN6wLk\">BabyTron</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6U3ybJ9UHNKEdsH7ktGBZ7\">JID</a>, and others. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi",

Reid) Dyer in 2018 with some home recordings after the dissolution of his first band, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4JxlJlzEHVTEFmFsuFiwhE\" data-name=\"Furnsss\">Furnsss</a> in Bristol, Connecticut. Influences for early MILLY included groups like <a href=\"spotify:artist:5hAhrnb0Ch4ODwWu4tsbpi\" data-name=\"Yo La Tengo\">Yo La Tengo</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Zk7We5BZoDR40himAI86D\" data-name=\"Swirlies\">Swirlies</a>. Once Dyer picked up and moved to Los Angeles, several live lineups were pasted together and shows followed. After signing to Dangerbird Records in 2019, the band went out on their first US tour supporting shoegaze legends <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Sd7X8SxWV0AyDLbvd4uEu\" data-name=\"Swervedriver\">Swervedriver</a>. A couple of EPs (<a href=\"spotify:album:5m2Bpvlqgg24halkJXW880\" data-name=\"Our First Four Songs &#43; Wish Goes On\">Our First Four Songs &#43; Wish Goes On</a>) and 1 LP (Eternal Ring) all of which were produced by Corey Coffman of Gleemer, were released and met with fan and critic acclaim alike. Warm layers of slack and shamble that call back to a language they speak quite fluently (Pavement, Duster, Hum). 2022 and 2023 saw the band on tour with likeminded acts such as  <a href=\"spotify:artist:6g12mLVmai580Y6SQnGjcd\" data-name=\"waveform*\">waveform*</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3K2gErmF9xLdo6dqOj1VbI\" data-name=\"Teethe\">Teethe</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7wgq6QJrXri0Mn31MCZmnt\" data-name=\"Bedlocked\">Bedlocked</a> (to name a few) and the band released an EP of Sebadoh covers in the spring of 2023 and a new song entitled Grab The Wheel in October of 2023... a power pop gem that channels the feel good vibe of Teenage Fanclub paired with the hypnotizing synths of The Rentals. Grab The Wheel is the first of many from their session with producer Sonny Diperri, (DIIV, Julie, Narrow Head) that the band are slated to roll out in 2024.\n\n MILLY&#39;s current lineup consists of Dyer (Vocals, Guitars), along with Yarden Erez (Bass/Vocals), Conner Frankel (Drums), and live guitarist Nico Moreta.",

Their fifth studio album is an eight-track collection, and an expert distillation of their best gifts that impels you to move, and cry, and listen closely and is bound to be a landmark in their catalog.",

        "biography": "Performing a distinct Atlanta trap style but hailing from the Pacific Northwest, rapper Lil Mosey made his breakthrough in late 2017 with the viral hit \"Pull Up.\" With its trap bass, light melody, and a singsong delivery similar to <a href=\"spotify:artist:6icQOAFXDZKsumw3YXyusw\">Lil Yachty</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7pFeBzX627ff0VnN6bxPR4\">Desiigner</a>, the track notched millions of streams for the teenaged Seattle musician, who issued his first tape, NorthsBest, in 2018. The follow-up Certified Hitmaker featured <a href=\"spotify:artist:7bXgB6jMjp9ATFy66eO08Z\">Chris Brown</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hlmm7s2ICUX0LVIhVFlZQ\">Gunna</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6Xgp2XMz1fhVYe7i6yNAax\">Trippie Redd</a>, debuting on the album chart in 2019 at number 12. It also spawned the number eight Billboard Hot 100 single \"Blueberry Faygo\" in 2020 and paved the way for more tracks, like \"Jumpin' Out the Face\" and 2021's \"Holy Water.\" The 2022 EP Uni preceded his third album.\r\n\nRaised by his mother in the north side of the Emerald City, Lil Mosey started rapping in his early teens, inspired by <a href=\"spotify:artist:20sxb77xiYeusSH8cVdatc\">Meek Mill</a>'s Dreams and Nightmares. He dropped out of high school to pursue a music career, heading down to Los Angeles to record. Mosey issued his early songs online, building a following with tracks \"Off White\" and \"So Bad,\" which both appeared on his debut mixtape, 2017's self-released NorthsBest. \"Pull Up\" arrived at year's end and carried him into 2018, when he issued the follow-up single \"Boof Pack\" on <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Interscope+Records%22\">Interscope Records</a>. \r\n\nAs Lil Mosey's exposure grew, he joined national jaunts with the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:21dooacK2WGBB5amYvKyfM\">SmokePurpp</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2HO2kO7O5gEnM91dhobllP\">Smooky Margiela</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4MCBfE4596Uoi2O4DtmEMz\">Juice Wrld</a>. \"Pull Up\" then appeared on Mosey's 2018 full-length Northsbest, an entirely different release than his previous mixtape. The album debuted inside of the Top 30 of the Billboard 200 and included the hit single \"Noticed,\" which made Billboard's Hot 100, reached number 37 on the Hot R&B Songs chart, and went on to achieve platinum certification. The single \"Bust Down Cartier\" appeared in the spring of 2019, followed by \"G Walk\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:7bXgB6jMjp9ATFy66eO08Z\">Chris Brown</a>. The latter track landed on Mosey's sophomore effort, Certified Hitmaker, which arrived at the end of the year. Debuting on the Billboard 200 at number 12, the set also featured verses from <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hlmm7s2ICUX0LVIhVFlZQ\">Gunna</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6Xgp2XMz1fhVYe7i6yNAax\">Trippie Redd</a>. \r\n\nMosey was quick to return in 2020, releasing a handful of collaborations like \"Back at It\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:5f7VJjfbwm532GiveGC0ZK\">Lil Baby</a>, \"Top Gone\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:47MpMsUfWtgyIIBEFOr4FE\">Lunay</a>, and \"Blueberry Faygo,\" the latter of which peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100. Another single, \"Holy Water,\" arrived in February 2021. Throughout the year, Mosey delivered additional solo singles like \"Try Me\" and \"Not the Same God as Mine\" while joining <a href=\"spotify:artist:6MPCFvOQv5cIGfw3jODMF0\">Internet Money</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4Ga1P7PMIsmqEZqhYZQgDo\">Lil Tecca</a> on the hit \"Jetski.\" In 2022, Mosey issued singles like \"Falling\" and \"Breathin Again,\" as well as the EP Uni, leading up to the release of his third full-length. ~ Neil Z.

        "biography": "China-born, Vancouver-based singer/songwriter Wanting makes heartfelt and melodic adult alternative pop. Born Wanting Qu in 1983 in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China, Wanting grew up listening to a mix of Chinese and Western artists including Jonathan Lee, Emil Wakin Chau, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0p4nmQO2msCgU4IF37Wi3j\">Avril Lavigne</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5rScKX1Sh1U67meeUyTGwk\">Michelle Branch</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4NgNsOXSwIzXlUIJcpnNUp\">Sarah McLachlan</a>, and others. However, it wasn't until she left home to study abroad in Canada in 2000 that she began to explore her own interest in singing. During this time, Wanting sang in a rock band, and by 2008 had begun writing her own solo singer/songwriter material. In 2009, she signed to <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Nettwerk%22\">Nettwerk</a>. A year later, her song \"Drenched\" garnered her more attention after it was used in the soundtrack to the 2010 Honk Kong film Love in the Buff. In 2012, Wanting released her debut album, Everything in the World, which went platinum in China, with Say the Words arriving the following year. In 2015, she returned with the single \"Love Birds.\" Two years later, she released her third full-length outing, LLL, which was produced by Justin Gray (<a href=\"spotify:artist:5y2Xq6xcjJb2jVM54GHK3t\">John Legend</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4iHNK0tOyZPYnBU7nGAgpQ\">Mariah Carey</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5YGY8feqx7naU7z4HrwZM6\">Miley Cyrus</a>). ~ Matt Collar, Rovi",

        "biography": "Charting singer and songwriter Natanael Cano is at the forefront of the 21st century corridos tumbados (aka \"trap corridos\") movement whose artists add hip-hop beats, production traits, rapping, chanting, and other urbano trappings to Mexico's 150-year-old folk song tradition. Cano joins a handful of like-minded artists in stretching the corrido form, like <a href=\"spotify:artist:2MMXs21RASEwAmU7gRheQ0\">Arsenal Efectivo</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bw2Am3p9ji3mYsXNXtQcd\">Piso 21</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0ys2OFYzWYB5hRDLCsBqxt\">Fuerza Regida</a>. Best known for his 2019 hit collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4q3ewBCX7sLwd24euuV69X\">Bad Bunny</a> on the remix single \"Soy el Diablo,\" Cano had been working on the style since his mid-teens, as evidenced by smash YouTube singles such as \"El F1\" and \"El Drip.\" Those tracks rang up tens of millions of views and paved the way for 2019's Corridos Tumbados, which hit number four on Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart. Also that year, his song \"El de la Codeína\" topped Apple Music's Latino chart. Along with 2020's Soy El Nata and Las 3 Torres (a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4o0NtnL2m0lzZmEdRas1qv\">Ovi</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7Gi6gjaWy3DxyilpF1a8Is\">Junior H</a>), he has remained a Billboard Latin chart favorite, hitting number 15 with 2020's Trap Tumbado, number nine with 2021's A Mis 20, and number 12 with 2022's NataKong. The 15-track Nata Montana peaked at five on the Top Latin Albums chart.\r\n\nCano was born in Hermosillo, in the state of Sonora, in 2001. Though he loved music from a very young age, his parents had no idea it would completely take over. At 13 years old, he began teaching himself to play the guitar -- his family couldn't afford music lessons -- from <a href=\"spotify:artist:5s31VTVh96lZBPphv51mIH\">Ariel Camacho</a> videos. He dropped out of school at age 16 to pursue music full-time, and by 17 he was already posting videos of his own songs to YouTube and other social media channels. At 18, the <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Rancho+Humilde%22\">Rancho Humilde</a> label, an organization led by Jimmy Humilde with its finger forever on the pulse of the underground, signed Cano and began issuing singles to SoundCloud and YouTube; early efforts such as \"El de la Codeína\" and \"Perfecta\" garnered interest immediately. \r\n\nIn 2019, both artist and label began an assault on social media and streaming with a bounty of singles including \"Soy el Diablo,\" \"El de los Gentes Gucci,\" \"El Drip,\" and others. In the spring, Cano issued a ten-track digital mini-album entitled Todos Es Diferente; the latter half featured guest <a href=\"spotify:artist:39sUQ6z3CTsNB4BhBecLOg\">Ruben Figueroa</a> (\"El Gryffindor\"). In the fall, Puerto Rican star <a href=\"spotify:artist:4q3ewBCX7sLwd24euuV69X\">Bad Bunny</a> was so taken with Cano's single \"Soy el Diablo\" that the singer heard about it and approached him to add a remix. Cano happily obliged and branched out into Mexican music for the first time. <a href=\"spotify:artist:4q3ewBCX7sLwd24euuV69X\">Bunny</a> began teasing the release on Instagram weeks before its release. On Halloween 2019, <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Rancho+Humilde%22\">Rancho Humilde</a> issued Corridos Tumbados, featuring a stripped-down sound that relied solely on bass and guitar rhythms; corrido's de rigueur instruments, tuba and accordion, were absent. The record entered the Mexican albums chart at number one. In July 2020, Cano released the <a href=\"spotify:artist:7MP4jhYmFEgb0AtiOkw55s\">Play N Skillz</a>- and Young Hollywood-produced EP Trap Tumbado. A proper full-length, Soy El Nata, arrived that September, followed in December by Las 3 Torres, a collaborative album with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4o0NtnL2m0lzZmEdRas1qv\">Ovi</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7Gi6gjaWy3DxyilpF1a8Is\">Junior H</a>. In May 2021, he released his sixth studio album, A Mis 20, hitting number nine on Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart. Another full-length, NataKong, arrived in April 2022 and featured collaborations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:77AiFEVeAVj2ORpC85QVJs\">Steve Aoki</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4aWhlVjiUjYHpVWBPP8AFc\">Grupo Codiciado</a>. It reached number 12 on Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart. \r\n\n2023's Nata Montana offered 15 harrowing corridos tumbados with expansive production sounds. Its guest list included Peso Pluma (\"Pancakes\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:7Gi6gjaWy3DxyilpF1a8Is\">Junior H</a> (\"Eres\"), and Chino Pacas (\"En Corto\"), among others. It peaked at five on the Top Latin Albums list. ~ Thom Jurek, Rovi",

My parents are both vietnamese, but I was born and raised in Germany. Here I began to play the piano when I was four years old – which must have sounded really bad back then. I quickly learned that following sheet music felt suffocating and restricting, which made me move into improvisation and composing by ear pretty early.\n\nI started to publish my music in 2009 on my YouTube channel, which is still active to this day – mostly uploading piano covers of popular songs and some sad and emotional compositions at first. I am now transitioning into a more nostalgic and minimalistic style – easy to listen to and perfect as background music. \n\nOne of my minimalism piano projects is called &#39;The Silent City&#39; – a collection of music dedicated to the loneliness and melancholy of today&#39;s cities, but also the little pieces of happiness and joyfullness of its everyday life. I have also created a new artist alias called &#39;like gentle rain&#39; focussing on a deeper, more melancholic and nostalgic piano style.\n\nYou can find me on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and all streaming platforms as &#64;BigRicePiano\n\nThank you so much for listening and support! Every single one of you is one reason, why I continue to make music.",

        "biography": "With her four-octave vocal acrobatics and iconic image, American singer, songwriter, and actress Ariana Grande has solidified her place as one of the quintessential pop stars of her generation, racking up stacks of awards and chart records in the process. Emerging in the early 2010s with the hit single \"The Way,\" Grande was primed to follow in the footsteps of her biggest influences, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6XpaIBNiVzIetEPCWDvAFP\">Whitney Houston</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4iHNK0tOyZPYnBU7nGAgpQ\">Mariah Carey</a>, due in part to her powerhouse vocals. With its <a href=\"spotify:artist:3aVoqlJOYx31lH1gibGDt3\">Babyface</a> production, her debut, Yours Truly, underscored her debt to '90s R&B, but Grande quickly incorporated hip-hop and EDM into her sound. \"Problem,\" a 2014 smash duet with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5yG7ZAZafVaAlMTeBybKAL\">Iggy Azalea</a>, was the first indication of her development, an evolution reinforced by the hits \"Bang Bang\" and \"Love Me Harder.\" Grande maintained her popularity with 2016's Dangerous Woman, then really hit her stride with 2018's Sweetener and its swift sequel, Thank U, Next, whose title track sat atop the U.S. singles chart for seven weeks. That achievement was quickly equaled by the album's glitzy second single, \"7 Rings,\" and later with \"Positions,\" the lead single from 2020's R&B-heavy album of the same name. After four years without an album -- a relative eternity considering her turn-of-the-decade blitz -- Grande returned with Eternal Sunshine, which she recorded while shooting the film version of Broadway's Wicked.\r\n\nA native of Boca Raton, Florida, where she was born in 1993 to graphic designer Edward Butera and Joan Grande (the CEO of Hose-McCann Communications), Grande began singing and acting at an early age, appearing in local theater productions. In 2008, when she was 15, she landed the role of Charlotte in the Broadway production of 13; her performance was well-received, and she won a National Youth Theatre Association Award. Following an appearance in the 2010 <a href=\"spotify:artist:7KgW65389e5w4xWzaVOuCg\">Desmond Child</a>-written musical Cuba Libre, Grande was cast as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television program Victorious. The show ran until 2012, at which time Grande's Cat Valentine was spun off into a show called Sam & Cat, which also starred <a href=\"spotify:artist:3AoFRPmkjP1WTi2Zu7gbZV\">Jennette McCurdy</a> of iCarly.\r\n\nAs she kept herself busy with television, Grande began to pursue a musical career. She frequently made appearances at sporting events and with symphonies, and she made her first appearances on record with the soundtrack to Victorious. In 2011, she released the single \"Put Your Hearts Up,\" which was cut during sessions for a teen-oriented pop album; she later disowned the single due to its kiddie feel. Grande felt much more comfortable with \"The Way,\" her 2013 single featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:4LLpKhyESsyAXpc4laK94U\">Mac Miller</a>. This signaled a mature direction and audiences responded, taking it to the Top Ten in the U.S., where it was eventually certified triple platinum. It was the first single from her 2013 debut, Yours Truly, which also featured hits in \"Baby I\" and \"Right There.\"\r\n\nAt the end of the year, she released a seasonal EP called Christmas Kisses, but her real efforts went into the recording of her second album, My Everything. Preceded by the single \"Problem\" -- a song that featured a guest spot from <a href=\"spotify:artist:5yG7ZAZafVaAlMTeBybKAL\">Iggy Azalea</a>, the \"It girl\" of the summer of 2014; it peaked at two on the U.S. charts and was certified double platinum -- the album featured a host of different producers, including <a href=\"spotify:artist:1rjeVTt9Ra1ldvN7SpeK0G\">Max Martin</a>, Shellback, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4we5S2VLjgY9KzIzApL1KI\">Ryan Tedder</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5CiGnKThu5ctn9pBxv7DGa\">Benny Blanco</a>. It was released at the end of August 2014, hitting number one on charts across the globe. Subsequent singles featured assists by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2qxJFvFYMEDqd7ui6kSAcq\">Zedd</a> (\"Break Free\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:2gsggkzM5R49q6jpPvazou\">Jessie J</a> & <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a> (\"Bang Bang\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a> (\"Love Me Harder\"). At one point in 2014, three of her songs were in the Billboard Top Ten at the same time, a feat matched only by <a href=\"spotify:artist:4dpARuHxo51G3z768sgnrY\">Adele</a>. By the time fifth single \"One Last Time\" charted in early 2015, My Everything had sold nearly 600,000 copies. \r\n\nAs that album's cycle wound down, Grande guest-starred on Ryan Murphy's campy slasher series Scream Queens and she also recorded another holiday EP, Christmas & Chill. In October 2015, Grande released the single \"Focus,\" which debuted at number seven on the Hot 100 and was certified platinum the following January. That February, she announced her third album, Dangerous Woman, and released the album's title track as a single in March. The song hit number eight on the Hot 100, making Grande the first artist to have the lead single from each of her first three albums debut in the Top Ten. Featuring collaborations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4ylR3zwA0zaapAu94fktwa\">Macy Gray</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a>, the album appeared in May 2016 and debuted at number two. It eventually went platinum, helped by a trio of Top Ten hits and a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album. Grande began 2017 by duetting with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5y2Xq6xcjJb2jVM54GHK3t\">John Legend</a> on \"Beauty and the Beast,\" the title track for <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Disney%22\">Disney</a>'s live-action remake of the 1991 animated classic. She then mounted her Dangerous Woman Tour, performing across North America and Europe during the first half of 2017. \r\n\nTragedy struck on May 22, 2017, when a suicide bomber attacked Grande's concert at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England. Grande returned to performing on June 4, when she held a star-studded charity concert called One Love Manchester to aid the victims of the bombing. Following the show, she resumed the Dangerous Woman Tour, which concluded in Hong Kong that September.\r\n\nIn April 2018, Grande kicked off promotion for her fourth album, Sweetener, by issuing the single \"No Tears Left to Cry,\" which debuted at number three on the Hot 100. It was followed by \"God Is a Woman\" later that year. Upon its release in August 2018, Sweetener debuted at number one in both the U.S. and U.K. \r\n\nThree months after the release of Sweetener, Grande returned with the non-LP single \"Thank U, Next.\" Quickly becoming an internet sensation, \"Thank U, Next\" shot to number one throughout the world, as did Grande's next single, \"7 Rings.\" Both songs were featured on the full-length album Thank U, Next, which appeared in February 2019. Her fourth U.S. number one, the set also topped the charts in over a dozen countries, further buoyed by third single \"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored.\" Mere months after the release of Thank U, Next, Grande moved on with a series of collaborations, including \"Monopoly\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:63XBtGSEZINSyXylZxEUbv\">Victoria Monet</a>, \"Boyfriend\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5UjifI1TYefXWn9GdqDOHl\">Social House</a>, and the Charlie's Angels reboot theme \"Don't Call Me Angel\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5YGY8feqx7naU7z4HrwZM6\">Miley Cyrus</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:00FQb4jTyendYWaN8pK0wa\">Lana Del Rey</a>. Capping off the year, Grande was nominated for five Grammy Awards: Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Thank U, Next, Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"7 Rings,\" and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for \"Boyfriend.\" She capped this prolific period with k bye for now, a live album recorded at various stops throughout her 2019 Sweetener World Tour.\r\n\nGrande had duets reach the top of the Billboard charts in early 2020 -- first it was \"Stuck with U\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1uNFoZAHBGtllmzznpCI3s\">Justin Bieber</a>, then it was \"Rain on Me\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1HY2Jd0NmPuamShAr6KMms\">Lady Gaga</a> -- before she launched her next album, Positions, with the release of its title track. The single reached number one just before the October 30 release of the album, which became her fifth to top the Billboard 200. \"34+35\" kept her planted toward the upper reaches of the singles chart, boosted by a 2021 remix with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5cj0lLjcoR7YOSnhnX0Po5\">Doja Cat</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:181bsRPaVXVlUKXrxwZfHK\">Megan Thee Stallion</a>. That same year, she teamed up with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a> on a remix of his song \"Save Your Tears,\" delivering another chart-topper for both artists. They repeated this same success two years later when Grande appeared on a remix of \"Die for You\" from <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a>'s Starboy album.\r\n\nDuring this time, Grande had also pivoted back to acting, appearing in the 2021 ensemble satire Don't Look Up, for which she recorded \"Just Look Up\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0fA0VVWsXO9YnASrzqfmYu\">Kid Cudi</a>. She was also cast as Glinda in the film adaptation of Wicked, which began filming in 2022. In 2023, Grande celebrated a decade since her debut with the Yours Truly (Tenth Anniversary Edition) reissue. \r\n\nThe following year, she kicked off her next album cycle with the chart-topping, '90s-club-inspired \"yes, and?\" and a remix version featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:4iHNK0tOyZPYnBU7nGAgpQ\">Mariah Carey</a>. The single paved the way for her seventh overall album, Eternal Sunshine, which arrived in March 2024. A conceptual journey through divorce and the sparks of new love, the set featured production by <a href=\"spotify:artist:1rjeVTt9Ra1ldvN7SpeK0G\">Max Martin</a> and Ilya Salmanzadeh, and balanced upbeat empowerment with reflective vulnerability. The album, which also spawned the Hot 100 singles \"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)\" and \"The Boy Is Mine,\" topped the Billboard 200. It also picked up three Grammy nominations, including Best Pop Vocal Album. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi",

        "biography": "Irish singer, songwriter, and pop star Shane Filan enjoyed massive success throughout the 2000s as a member of the chart-topping boy band <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Z1CCuBsyhEHngq3U5IraY\">Westlife</a> before launching a successful career as a solo artist in the following decade. During <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Z1CCuBsyhEHngq3U5IraY\">Westlife</a>'s 14-year tenure, the band managed to amass no fewer than 14 U.K. number one hits before marking their dissolution with a summer 2012 show in Dublin in front of 80,000 fans. Multi-platinum albums like Coast to Coast (2000) and World of Our Own (2001) cemented the group's place in U.K. chart history, and while Filan's subsequent solo career hasn't risen to quite such towering heights, he has remained a strong chart presence and developed his own voice as a songwriter, especially on his 2013 debut, You & Me.\r\n\nBorn in Sligo, Ireland during the last summer of the '70s, Filan went on to develop his singing voice as part of various school productions, as well as in performances at the local Hawk's Well Theatre. Before his 20th birthday he had already achieved his first number one single with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Z1CCuBsyhEHngq3U5IraY\">Westlife</a>, when they issued their Steve Mac-produced debut, \"Swear It Again.\" From 1999's Westlife to 2010's Gravity, all but two of their ten studio albums reached the top of the Irish albums chart, and following the October 2012 announcement of the band's plan to part ways, Filan was strongly rumored to be talking to various labels about a solo deal. He spent much of 2012 and early 2013 writing new material, and in April 2013 it was revealed that Filan had signed with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22London+Records%22\">London Records</a>. \r\n\nHis first solo single, \"Everything to Me,\" nodded to the mainstream folk of <a href=\"spotify:artist:16oZKvXb6WkQlVAjwo2Wbg\">the Lumineers</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3gd8FJtBJtkRxdfbTu19U2\">Mumford & Sons</a>, and, like every other track on the full-length You & Me, it was co-written by Filan. Recorded in Dublin, London, and Nashville, You & Me kept the singer in the Irish and U.K. Top Ten and set the table for his 2015 follow-up, Right Here, which saw him switching to <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Warner+Bros.%22\">Warner Bros.</a> imprint <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22East+West+Records%22\">East West Records</a>. That same year Filan also published the autobiography My Side of Life. For his third solo outing, he took a thematic approach, offering an album of some of his favorite love songs along with a handful of originals. Released in 2017, with a deluxe version arriving a year later, Love Always saw Filan reinterpreting songs by <a href=\"spotify:artist:74ASZWbe4lXaubB36ztrGX\">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7ohlPA8dRBtCf92zaZCaaB\">Crowded House</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:51l0uqRxGaczYr4271pVIC\">the Bangles</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6Ff53KvcvAj5U7Z1vojB5o\">*NSYNC</a>. ~ James Wilkinson, Rovi",

        "biography": "Japanese singer, composer, and keyboardist Mayumi Itsuwa is a pop vocalist known for her sweeping torch songs and stirring vibrato. Debuting in 1972 with her first album Shojo, she became a popular presence throughout Asia in the next decade, scoring a crossover smash with the chart-topping hit \"Koibito yo\" from the 1980 album of the same name. Maintaining a chart presence well into the '90s, she has since become a beloved figure in Japanese popular music.\r\n\nBorn in 1951, the Tokyo-bred artist recorded her 1972 debut in Los Angeles alongside producer John Fischbach and contributors David Campbell, <a href=\"spotify:artist:319yZVtYM9MBGqmSQnMyY6\">Carole King</a>, and Charles Larkey. Shojo rose to number six on the Japanese charts, where her early works were a Top 40 mainstay throughout the decade. Her first number one arrived in 1980 in the form of Koibito yo. Boosted by the title track single, the song and album were hits outside of her native Japan and marked her highest-ever placement on the charts. In addition to staying at the top of the Japanese charts for three consecutive weeks, the album also scored a \"Gold Prize\" at the 1980 Japan Record Awards. Subsequent efforts such as Shunshu, Marionette, and Shiosai kept Itsuwa in the Top Ten, as numerous compilations filled the gaps between studio albums. \r\n\nItsuwa continued to release new music into the '90s and the new millennium, rising to the upper reaches of the Japanese charts in 2007 with Welcome and again in 2013 with Mayumi Itsuwa 40th Anniversary Best Album [Lovers & Friends]. In 2022, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of her debut, she issued Mayumi Itsuwa Premium Best HISTORY. ~ Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi",

Begun at age 21, the project serves as the musical equivalent of a time capsule, documenting Chhadva’s adult musical life with a yearly album. Each album is created with two key rules: everything must be started and finished in a single day, and every track must be recorded in a single, honest take. The project embraces raw imperfection, capturing moments of creativity without polish, re-dos, or editing.\n\nThe songs are often recorded directly onto a vintage tape machine, preserving their unfiltered authenticity. Each track is titled with the exact time it was recorded, turning the music into personal timestamps of Chhadva’s life.\n\nThe first Picture Frames album was recorded on December 26, 2023, during a single day with friends documenting the process, some of it on Super8 film. Now 22, Chhadva has continued the tradition with a second album, with songs expected to start rolling out in spring of 2025.\n\nThis project is a celebration of imperfection, freedom, and growth, offering listeners snapshots of a life lived through sound.",

        "biography": "Kokia never topped the Oricon charts, but her exquisite, honed brand of J-pop brought her a number of theme song contracts for video games, TV shows, and anime series, and won a devoted fan base, not just in Japan but overseas (particularly France) as well. Born Akiko Yoshida in 1976, she took up violin at the age of three, learned to play piano, and attended a music school in the U.S. twice, the first time with her sister Kyoko, later a professional violinist. She studied at the prestigious Toho Gakuen School of Music, and soon attracted scouts from <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Pony+Canyon%22\">Pony Canyon</a> and debuted as a pop singer in 1998 as Kokia (which is an anagram of her real name). Her debut song, \"For Little Tail,\" was featured on the soundtrack for the Tail Concerto video game, and the same year she released her first single, \"Aishiteiru Kara,\" used in the TV drama Brothers. The second single, \"Ai no Field,\" used in the anime Brain Powerd, was written by the famous soundtrack composer <a href=\"spotify:artist:0lbYsAt8JNKNjttbncKg8i\">Yoko Kanno</a>, but soon Kokia began to write songs herself, the first being the single \"Arigatou...\" (1999), which had a TV drama tie-in and was well-received in Taiwan as well as Hong Kong, where it even brought her a local music award. The debut full-length Songbird came in 1999, but failed to chart, prompting a hiatus that ended in 2001 with her crossing over to <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Victor+Entertainment%22\">Victor Entertainment</a>. Her second album, Trip Trip, did not make it to the Oricon as well, but the song \"A Gift\" was used in Subaru ads worldwide, and \"Kawaranai Koto (Since 1976),\" featured in the anime Hungry Heart Wild Striker, became her first Top 50 single (it charted at number 47). The single \"The Power of Smile\"/\"Remember the Kiss\" and the album Remember Me both charted at number 15, becoming her best-selling releases in their respective categories. In 2003, <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Pony+Canyon%22\">Pony Canyon</a> also used two of her old songs in the Chinese TV drama At Dolphin Bay.\r\n\nThe fourth album Uta ga Chikara came in 2004, spawning two singles with more tie-ins, both released in 2005, when Kokia began her European foray: she played in Paris at the famous MIDEM music industry fair and released the compilation Pearl not just in Japan, but in Spain and France as well. This seemed to strengthen her desire for independence, and in 2006, Kokia established her own label, Anco&co, and began her collaboration with the French <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Wasabi+Records%22\">Wasabi Records</a>, which put out her album Aigakikoeru half a year before its Japanese release. In Japan, Aigakikoeru still came out on <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Victor%22\">Victor</a>, as she opted not to quit the label. The record only charted at number 67 on the Oricon, but the song \"Follow the Nightingale,\" used in the game Tales of Innocence, was more successful, entering the Top 40. Kokia took up the pace after that, releasing three albums -- the neo-classical The Voice, the Irish-themed Fairy Dance, and the self-explanatory Christmas Gift -- in 2008 and two more (Akiko Kokia Balance and Kokia Akiko Balance) in 2009, when she also held her first European tour. She had three more tie-ins with anime series in the late 2000s, and for her 11th album, Real World (2010), she traveled to Tunisia. ~ Alexey Eremenko, Rovi",

This innate understanding also helped him to pick up the drums, which he played for 10 years in a punk band performing predominantly in his native Sweden, as well as touring in Canada.\n\nIn 2016, Gunnar - as Alan Ellis - released the EPs <a href=\"spotify:album:6y7clnHpbEuNlYRnagswVL\" data-name=\"Washed In Light\">Washed In Light</a> and <a href=\"spotify:album:7HzNR4uXmBuoJXtea8E01z\" data-name=\"Our Precious Lives\">Our Precious Lives</a>, as well as the album <a href=\"spotify:album:0gPXYxrGPArkcbUDWUkYYi\" data-name=\"Morning Dew\">Morning Dew</a>.

        "biography": "Ducks Ltd. are a Toronto band featuring Australian lead guitarist Evan Lewis and U.K-born, U.S.-raised singer, bassist, and rhythm guitarist Tom McGreevy. As Ducks Ltd., the two thrive on skirting the edges of buoyant jangle pop and driving power pop. Their latest album, Harm’s Way, contains anxious songs that McGreevy explains are “about struggling. About watching people I care for suffer, and trying to figure out how to be there for them. And about the strain of living in the world when it feels like it’s ready to collapse.”\n\nHarm’s Way is an undeniable evolution of Ducks Ltd.’s songwriting process. Where their critically acclaimed 2021 debut Modern Fiction and 2019 EP Get Bleak were self-recorded and self-produced in a Toronto basement, here, they made an LP in Chicago with producer Dave Vettraino and some of their favorite musicians. These collaborators include Finom’s Macie Stewart, Ratboys’ Julia Steiner and Marcus Nuccio, Dehd’s Jason Balla, Moontype’s Margaret McCarthy, Lawn’s Rui De Magalhaes, Dummy’s Nathan O’Dell, and Patio’s Lindsey-Paige McCloy. Ducks Ltd.’s touring drummer Jonathan Pappo also appears on the LP. \n\n “Our relationship is built on trust and we don’t let our egos come into the creative process in any way,” says Lewis. “We have this really great thing where every decision with the band is filtered through both of us. Here especially, we really figured out how to make something that truly sounds like us.”",

        "biography": "The whimsical, wildly talented Korean-Canadian artist Luna Li’s sophomore album, When a Thought Grows Wings, is a snapshot of its creator in flux. For the 27-year-old, born Hannah Bussiere Kim, the journey was tumultuous, pivotal, and necessary: she split with her partner of eight years, left her hometown of Toronto for LA, and found her world opening up in new ways.\n“It was really me discovering who I was as an adult for the first time,” she says. “I was really stepping into my own and taking my life into my own hands.”\n\nLi — who first started playing piano at five, now plays violin, guitar, bass, drums, mini-harp, flute — cut her teeth in Toronto’s live music scene, but won over a new legion of fans during the pandemic posting solo bedroom jams, playing every instrument, cut together to create soothing, noodly grooves. Li’s 2022 debut LP, Duality, established her mode for creating cinematic dream-pop.\n\nWith tours opening for Japanese Breakfast, Wolf Alice, and beabadobee under her belt, and working with producers Monsune (SZA, Drake) and Andrew Lappin (L’Rain), When a Thought Grows Wings is a sonic and emotional level-up. Weaving her harp-rippled, baroque-pop through with jazz flute and gritty riffs, the album is a testament to Luna Li’s prowess as a charismatic frontperson, songwriter, arranger, and continuously curious multi-instrumentalist. A portrait of Hannah Bussiere Kim on her journey, ever-evolving, the lines between Li and Kim artfully and deliberately blurred.",

        "biography": "“Do you still believe it?” John Ross asks that question after journeying through the wreckage. The genesis of Dulling The Horns goes back to late 2022, when Ross began workshopping new material during soundcheck on the ILYSM tour. Last summer, Wild Pink decamped to western Massachusetts to reunite with engineer Justin Pizzoferrato. Ross decided to record Dulling The Horns live in the room, in an effort to capture Wild Pink’s onstage style — rawer, grainier. Gone are the glimmering atmospherics and studio affectations of recent Wild Pink outings. Instead, Ross’ voice is haggard against the humid distortion coating every song. “I wanted to make economical songs,” Ross explains. “Music that is very much at its core three or four people rocking.” If before, Wild Pink took notes from Springsteen and Petty, they’ve now entered their Crazy Horse era. On Dulling The Horns, you can hear him rediscovering the fire in real time. Tropes discarded along the roadside, songs pulled from the formative DNA of rock music, all filtered through years of messy fog. “There is no answer to these problems,” Ross says, having eventually yielded. But as far Dulling The Horns is concerned, there’s at least one path forward: Burn it all away, and keep moving. The album was mixed by Alex Farrar in Asheville NC, mastered by Greg Obis in Chicago, IL and is out in October on Fire Talk.",

        "biography": "Nicki Minaj's unique combination of ferocity and humor and a rap style built on razor-sharp wordplay, mercilessly blunt lyricism, and delivery that turns on a dime from sugary to snarling, has skyrocketed her from mixtape phenom to enduring global pop star. The rapper's early days included attempts at an acting career and losing her job at Red Lobster for being rude to customers, but she progressed quickly from MySpace demos to nationally adored mixtapes to household-name status. Pink Friday, Minaj's 2010 album debut, saw her appeal to a broader audience with a chart-topping reception. Although she has had similar success with later full-lengths such as 2014's The Pinkprint and 2018's Queen, her singles have made an even greater impact. In just over a decade, Minaj has hit the Top 40 over two-dozen times as a headliner with singles such as \"Super Bass,\" \"Starships,\" and \"Anaconda.\" These and other highlights were compiled in 2022 for Queen Radio, Vol. 1, an anthology containing the number one hit \"Super Freaky Girl\" among its new songs. Her Top 40 entries as a featured artist are even more numerous and include <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>'s \"Monster,\" <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Cs0zKBU1kc0i8ypK3B9ai\">David Guetta</a>'s \"Turn Me On,\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:66CXWjxzNUsdJxJ2JdwvnR\">Ariana Grande</a>'s \"Side to Side.\" In 2023, Minaj finally released the long-awaited sequel to her debut with her fifth studio album Pink Friday 2.\r\n\nNicki Minaj was born <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ZFS9dRo0PtPBltix3eLpP\">Onika Tanya Maraj</a> in 1982. Born in Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago to parents who were both gospel singers, she lived with her grandmother in Saint James until the age of five, when she joined her mother, who had relocated to Queens, New York. In high school she discovered the performing arts, setting her sights on acting as her main pursuit. She eventually transitioned into music, working as part of a group called the Hood$tars in the early 2000s before going solo. In 2007 she was discovered by <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Dirty+Money+Entertainment%22\">Dirty Money Entertainment</a> CEO Big Fendi, who happened upon her demos on MySpace and signed <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ZFS9dRo0PtPBltix3eLpP\">Maraj</a> to the label. At Fendi's suggestion, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ZFS9dRo0PtPBltix3eLpP\">Maraj</a> took on the stage name Nicki Minaj, jumbling her last name to reflect a more ruthless persona. <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Dirty+Money+Entertainment%22\">Dirty Money Entertainment</a> released both her 2007 debut mixtape, Playtime Is Over, and its 2008 follow-up, Sucka Free. Industry buzz was already surrounding Minaj on her earliest releases, and these mixtapes featured guest appearances from stars like <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:13y7CgLHjMVRMDqxdx0Xdo\">Gucci Mane</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pnbUBPifNnlusY8kTBivi\">Jadakiss</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5tth2a3v0sWwV1C7bApBdX\">Lil' Kim</a>. \r\n\nThe 2009 mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty was a favorite among a growing fan base and included her first songs to hit the Billboard charts. In August of 2009 Minaj signed to <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Young+Money+Entertainment%22\">Young Money Entertainment</a>, becoming the label's first female artist. The floodgates opened from there, as Minaj made cameo appearances on tracks from <a href=\"spotify:artist:13y7CgLHjMVRMDqxdx0Xdo\">Gucci Mane</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0ONHkAv9pCAFxb0zJwDNTy\">Pusha T</a>, and others as well as offering verses to hits like \"Bedrock\" and \"Roger That\" from the 2009 <a href=\"spotify:artist:5OrB6Jhhrl9y2PK0pSV4VP\">Young Money</a> collaborative album We Are Young Money. An official non-mixtape debut album came in the form of Pink Friday, released in November of 2010 but preceded by the hit singles \"Your Love\" and \"Check It Out.\" The album saw her leaning more into a pop style than the hard-edged rap of her mixtapes, but the hybrid of the two proved immediately successful, and the album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and went platinum, selling upwards of 375,000 copies during its first week alone. She earned a handful of 2011 Grammy nominations, including Best New Artist, Best Rap Album, and Best Rap Performance. An all-out media blitz followed between albums, with extravagant performances at award shows across the globe, an appearance as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live, and joining <a href=\"spotify:artist:6tbjWDEIzxoDsBA1FuhfPW\">Madonna</a> -- alongside <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QJIPDAEDILuo8AIq3pMuU\">M.I.A.</a> -- for her Super Bowl XLVI halftime show.\r\n\nIn early 2012, the Euro-dance-influenced single \"Starships\" signaled the coming of her official sophomore effort, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, an album built around her devil-may-care alter ego \"Roman Zolanski.\" Guest artists included <a href=\"spotify:artist:20qISvAhX20dpIbOOzGK3q\">Nas</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1sBkRIssrMs1AbVkOJbc7a\">Rick Ross</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7bXgB6jMjp9ATFy66eO08Z\">Chris Brown</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4L3GTE04bW5N7azA9QPhjA\">Beenie Man</a>, while production came from the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:6O9WquDfQTxGRZqZUXVEQx\">RedOne</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3dTmCjNP73G0EdbhkWOXSx\">Ke'Noe</a>. The album hit number one on the U.S. album charts, driven by a Top Ten showing for \"Starships,\" and \"Va Va Voom\" also reached the Top 40. By the end of 2012, Minaj had been announced as a judge for the 12th season of American Idol, although she left at the end of the season. It hardly affected her success, as she set two career records during 2013: the most-charted female rapper in the history of Billboard's singles chart, and the first person to win Best Female Hip-Hop Artist at the BET Awards four times in a row. \r\n\nIn December 2014, Minaj released her third studio album, The Pinkprint. First single \"Lookin Ass\" was also featured on the <a href=\"spotify:artist:5OrB6Jhhrl9y2PK0pSV4VP\">Young Money</a> compilation Rise of an Empire released in March of that year, while follow-up \"Anaconda\" was nominated for Best Rap Song at the 2015 Grammy Awards. Filled with songs about guilt and failed relationships, the album was well received by critics and debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. Throughout 2016, Minaj guested on numerous singles, including <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QHgL1lAIqAw0HtD7YldmP\">DJ Khaled</a>'s \"Do You Mind\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:66CXWjxzNUsdJxJ2JdwvnR\">Ariana Grande</a>'s \"Side to Side,\" and she also released her own \"Black Barbies.\" In 2017, she issued a trio of stand-alone singles: \"Regret in Your Tears,\" \"Changed It\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, and \"No Frauds\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>. The latter track went gold and broke into the Top 20 of the Hot 100 and Top Ten of the R&B and rap charts. That year, she also appeared on the <a href=\"spotify:artist:6oMuImdp5ZcFhWP0ESe6mG\">Migos</a> track \"MotorSport\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4kYSro6naA4h99UJvo89HB\">Cardi B</a>, and on <a href=\"spotify:artist:07YZf4WDAMNwqr4jfgOZ8y\">Jason Derulo</a>'s \"Swalla\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7c0XG5cIJTrrAgEC3ULPiq\">Ty Dolla $ign</a>. \r\n\nShe returned with the singles \"Chun-Li\" and \"Barbie Tingz\" in spring 2018, paving the way for her fourth studio album, Queen, which arrived in August of that year. In addition to third single \"Bed\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:66CXWjxzNUsdJxJ2JdwvnR\">Ariana Grande</a>, the LP also features guests <a href=\"spotify:artist:2feDdbD5araYcm6JhFHHw7\">Labrinth</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR\">Eminem</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1wvlC6NwleHt1iRD6d5X2C\">Foxy Brown</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1zNqQNIdeOUZHb8zbZRFMX\">Swae Lee</a>. Upon release, Queen matched its predecessor with a number two debut on the Billboard 200. More singles arrived the following year, including the non-album track \"Megatron,\" \"Tusa\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:790FomKkXshlbRYZFtlgla\">Karol G</a>, \"Trollz\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7gZfnEnfiaHzxARJ2LeXrf\">6ix9ine</a>. Minaj was also featured alongside <a href=\"spotify:artist:3CbYyyd8wH3RT6t0jwpdzC\">Murda Beatz</a> on <a href=\"spotify:artist:21WS9wngs9AqFckK7yYJPM\">PnB Rock</a> 2019 track \"Fendi.\" In February 2020, the rapper returned with her own stand-alone song \"Yikes.\" Minaj's third mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty was reissued in 2021, eleven years after its original release. The project was given new cover art and the track listing was altered somewhat, omitting some of the songs from the original 2009 release and including several new tracks. This new version of Minaj's breakout project debuted in the number two spot on the Billboard 200, making it the highest-charting mixtape from a female rapper up to that point. \r\n\nThroughout the early 2020s, Minaj continued her usual bevy of guest features and collaborations, appearing on tracks by <a href=\"spotify:artist:5cj0lLjcoR7YOSnhnX0Po5\">Doja Cat</a>, former <a href=\"spotify:artist:3e7awlrlDSwF3iM0WBjGMp\">Little Mix</a> vocalist <a href=\"spotify:artist:73KwqWuob0R53I14Vs56p9\">Jesy Nelson</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6veh5zbFpm31XsPdjBgPER\">BIA</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b\">Elton John</a>. In 2022, she scored more hits as a lead artist with the <a href=\"spotify:artist:5f7VJjfbwm532GiveGC0ZK\">Lil Baby</a> collaborations \"Do We Have a Problem?\" and \"Bussin,\" then topped the pop chart with \"Super Freaky Girl.\" All three of these singles were included on Queen Radio, Vol. 1, a celebratory anthology released that August. Minaj kicked off 2023 with the flamenco- and trap-inspired \"Red Ruby da Sleeze,\" which she followed with a feature on <a href=\"spotify:artist:7wlFDEWiM5OoIAt8RSli8b\">YoungBoy Never Broke Again</a>'s \"WTF,\" as well as collaborative singles with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3LZZPxNDGDFVSIPqf4JuEf\">Ice Spice</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Xt3RrJMFv5SZkCfUE8C1J\">Kim Petras</a>, spots on tracks from <a href=\"spotify:artist:4O15NlyKLIASxsJ0PrXPfz\">Lil Uzi Vert</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3DbwFQlvLxRSi2uX8mf81A\">Sexyy Red</a>, and a very on-brand take on <a href=\"spotify:artist:6kBjAFKyd0he7LiA5GQ3Gz\">Aqua</a>'s \"Barbie World\" (again with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3LZZPxNDGDFVSIPqf4JuEf\">Ice Spice</a>) for the Barbie soundtrack Barbie The Album. \r\n\nIn September of 2023, Minaj released the slow-moving R&B song \"Last Time I Saw You\" following \"Super Freaky Girl\" as the second single to precede her fifth studio album, Pink Friday 2. A sequel to her 2010 studio debut, it had been in the works since 2019 and finally arrived in December of 2023, on the rapper's 41st birthday. Boasting a bevy guest spots from <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">J. Cole</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4O15NlyKLIASxsJ0PrXPfz\">Lil Uzi Vert</a>, and more, it found Minaj continuing to balance an array of pop, hip-hop, trap, and R&B sounds. The album topped both the Billboard 200 and R&B charts, and spawned singles into 2024, including \"Everybody,\" \"Press Play,\" and \"Big Difference.\" In January 2024, she also released the non-album single \"Big Foot.\" ~ David Jeffries & Fred Thomas",

        "biography": "The music made by METZ, Alex Edkins (guitar &amp; vocals), Hayden Menzies (drums), &amp; Chris Slorach (bass) has always been difficult to pin down. Their earliest recordings contained nods to the teeming energy of early ‘90s DIY hardcore, the aggravated angularities of This Heat, and the noisy riffing of AmRep’s quintessential guitar manglers, but there was never a moment where METZ sounded like they were paying tribute to the heroes of their youth. The sonic trajectory of their albums captures the journey of a band shedding influences and digging deeper into their fundamental core—steady propulsive drums, chest-thumping bass lines, bloody-fingered riffs, and the howling angst of fading innocence. \n\nIn 2020 METZ released their fourth studio LP, Atlas Vending, and 2021 saw them bring a raw and powerful live performance of the album via Live at the Opera House. 2022 has seen the release of three powerful singles including “Demolition Row” featured on a split with Adulkt Life, and “Come On Down” which features Joe Talbot of IDLES. October 2022 marks ten years of their self-titled debut album and to celebrate they have released a Deluxe Edition of the record featuring three tracks recorded in a BBC Maida Vale session at 2013.",

        "biography": "One Direction skillfully blended hooky songs, slick production, and winning personalities together in a way that made them one of the most popular boy bands ever, regardless of era or region. Made up of five distinct vocalists, the group was formed on the U.K. talent show X-Factor and over the course of six years topped the charts with million-selling singles and albums while filling arenas around the world. Their initial songs, like  2011's \"What Makes You Beautiful,\" were bubblegummy and sweet, but the band soon delved into other avenues including indie folk (\"Story of My Life\") and '80s rock. Despite their popularity never dipping, the band began to splinter in the mid-2000s, then went on hiatus in 2006.\r\n\nThe group was formed by <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Hsdzj7Dlq2I7tHP7501T4\">Niall Horan</a> from Mullingar, Ireland; <a href=\"spotify:artist:5ZsFI1h6hIdQRw2ti0hz81\">Zayn Malik</a> from Bradford; <a href=\"spotify:artist:6KImCVD70vtIoJWnq6nGn3\">Harry Styles</a> from Cheshire; <a href=\"spotify:artist:57WHJIHrjOE3iAxpihhMnp\">Louis Tomlinson</a> from Doncaster, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pUo3fmmHT8bhCyHE52hA6\">Liam Payne</a> from Wolverhampton (the latter had previously reached the judge's house stages of The X-Factor as a 14-year-old back in 2008). Each originally entered 2010's seventh series of The X Factor as individuals, but following a suggestion from guest judge <a href=\"spotify:artist:40xbWSB4JPdOkRyuTDy1oP\">Nicole Scherzinger</a>, they were grouped together to become One Direction. Mentored by Simon Cowell, they soon became one of the favorites to win the show, thanks to renditions of <a href=\"spotify:artist:3BmGtnKgCSGYIUhmivXKWX\">Kelly Clarkson</a>'s \"My Life Would Suck Without You,\" <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b\">Elton John</a>'s \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight,\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0SD4eZCN4Kr0wQk56hCdh2\">Bonnie Tyler</a>'s \"Total Eclipse of the Heart.\" However, despite receiving a standing ovation for their duet with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2HcwFjNelS49kFbfvMxQYw\">Robbie Williams</a> (\"She's the One\") in the live final, they eventually finished third behind <a href=\"spotify:artist:0CrCKxXekxMpkYfMEf8mca\">Rebecca Ferguson</a> and winner <a href=\"spotify:artist:3906URNmNa1VCXEeiJ3DSH\">Matt Cardle</a>. \r\n\nSpotting the potential of five <a href=\"spotify:artist:1uNFoZAHBGtllmzznpCI3s\">Justin Bieber</a>-esque teen pin-ups, Cowell signed them to his <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Syco%22\">Syco</a> label in a two-million dollar deal, and after performing on the X-Factor tour, the quintet began work on its debut album with Savan Kotecha (<a href=\"spotify:artist:26dSoYclwsYLMAKD3tpOr4\">Britney Spears</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7qG3b048QCHVRO5Pv1T5lw\">Enrique Iglesias</a>). Following a sponsorship deal with Nintendo DS and a book, Forever Young, named after their cover of the <a href=\"spotify:artist:0xliTEbFfy5HQHvsTknTkX\">Alphaville</a> classic that was intended to be their winner's song, they released their first single, \"What Makes You Beautiful,\" in late 2011. The full-length album Up All Night followed soon after. In 2012, One Direction became the first British band to debut on top of the Billboard 200 list when Up All Night sold over 176,000 copies during its first week of release in America.\r\n\nIn late 2012, One Direction released their sophomore album, Take Me Home. Highlighting more of the band's melodic pop, Take Me Home featured songs and production from Sweden's Carl Falk, Rami Yacoub, and Savan Kotecha, who worked on Up All Night, as well as contributions from singer/songwriter <a href=\"spotify:artist:6eUKZXaKkcviH0Ku9w2n3V\">Ed Sheeran</a>. The album proved to be another smash and topped charts around the world, earning multi-platinum certification in half-a-dozen countries. The singles \"Live While We're Young\" and \"Little Things\" also hit number one across the globe, and \"Kiss You\" reached the Top Ten in the U.S.\r\n\nOne Direction then embarked on a globe-spanning tour in which the band played over 100 shows, including six sold-out nights at London's massive O2 Arena. At the same time, they were being filmed by director Morgan Spurlock for This Is Us, a mix of documentary and concert footage that proved to be successful at the box office when it was released in August of 2013. While they were touring, One Direction also began work on their third album, Midnight Memories. Released just in time for the 2013 holidays, the record featured songwriting input from all the members, a new production team, and some new folk and '80s hair metal influences. It nearly outdid Take Me Home and Up All Night, peaking at number one in seven countries and spawning the singles \"Best Song Ever\" and \"Story of My Life.\" \r\n\nThe group toured the world for most of 2014, but still found time to record a fourth album, which was released in late 2014. Produced by the same team who handled Midnight Memories, Four similarly looked back to the '80s for inspiration and featured a new song from old friend <a href=\"spotify:artist:6eUKZXaKkcviH0Ku9w2n3V\">Ed Sheeran</a>. A pair of platinum singles, \"Steal My Girl\" and \"Night Changes,\" helped the album hit number one in nearly 20 countries.\r\n\nThe band returned to the road and a busy promotional schedule in 2015, during which <a href=\"spotify:artist:5ZsFI1h6hIdQRw2ti0hz81\">Malik</a> was often absent. He left the tour due to stress in early March, then officially quit the band a few days later. (He went on to become the first to pursue a solo career.) The four remaining members continued touring, and in July released \"Drag Me Down,\" the first single from their fifth album, Made in the A.M. Following the September announcement of the album, the bandmembers also revealed that, after the promotional efforts for the album were over, they'd be going on hiatus during 2016. Made in the A.M. was released in November of 2015, and featured the singles \"Infinity,\" \"Perfect,\" \"What a Feeling,\" and \"History.\" It performed very well commercially, peaking at number one in the U.K. and number two in the U.S. In 2016, the group went on hiatus, and the individual members all pursued solo careers to varying degrees of success. Hopes for a possible full band reunion were dashed when <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pUo3fmmHT8bhCyHE52hA6\">Liam Payne</a> died on October 16, 2024, in Buenos Aires. Following his passing, all five of One Direction's studio albums returned to the charts as fans mourned around the globe. ~ Jon O'Brien, Rovi",

It was there his life would change forever landing him offers from every record label from East to West. He then stayed in the Navy for another year and a half.

        "biography": "British dance group Clean Bandit found crossover success by weaving classical music with dance-pop for a beat-driven yet refined sound -- often delivered with high-profile guest vocalists. After scoring their first hit with the multi-platinum international sensation \"Rather Be,\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:4ScCswdRlyA23odg9thgIO\">Jess Glynne</a> (from 2014's New Eyes), they issued a string of U.K. chart-toppers that proved successful around the world, including \"Rockabye\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Isy6kedDrgPYoTS1dazA9\">Sean Paul</a> and Anne-Marie, \"Symphony\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xylc3o4UrD53lo9CvFvVg\">Zara Larsson</a>, and \"Solo\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6S2OmqARrzebs0tKUEyXyp\">Demi Lovato</a>, all of which were included on 2018's What Is Love? They again reached the U.K. Top Ten with 2020's \"Tick Tock\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:6fWVd57NKTalqvmjRd2t8Z\">24kGoldn</a> before releasing 2021's \"Higher\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6ASri4ePR7RlsvIQgWPJpS\">Iann Dior</a>. \r\n\nFounded in 2008 by schoolmates Grace Chatto (cello, percussion, and vocals), Jack Patterson (bass, keys, piano, and vocals), Luke Patterson (drums), and Neil Amin-Smith (violin and piano), they were originally dubbed the Chatto Quartet when they performed around their university. The classically trained string quartet performed <a href=\"spotify:artist:5aIqB5nVVvmFsvSdExz408\">J.S. Bach</a> and cited <a href=\"spotify:artist:5VRErWhTZd0si1lqt1DwoW\">Jacqueline du Pré</a> as an influence, but their post-show, wind-down music often consisted of garage, 2-step, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2JyWXPbkqI5ZJa3gwqVa0c\">Craig David</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3kjuyTCjPG1WMFCiyc5IuB\">Arcade Fire</a> tracks. The quartet members were aware of both producer Jon Wandeck and MC Ssegamic through the duo's photographic work, and when Wandeck suggested they play on one of his house music cuts, Clean Bandit were born. With MC Ssegamic on the mike, they released the genre-mashing \"Telephone Banking\" in the summer of 2011. Their Dance Armstrong mixtape followed in 2012, while 2013 saw the release of the Mozart's House EP. The \"Mozart House\" track also landed on their album New Eyes, which was released by major-label <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Atlantic%22\">Atlantic</a> in 2014. \r\n\nWhile early singles \"A+E\" and \"Dust Clears\" were modest chart successes in the U.K., it wasn't until the release of New Eyes' fourth single -- the <a href=\"spotify:artist:4ScCswdRlyA23odg9thgIO\">Jess Glynne</a>-featuring \"Rather Be\" -- that Clean Bandit truly entered the international mainstream. The multi-platinum song became the second best-selling track in the U.K. in 2014 and won a Grammy for Best Dance Recording in 2015. The success of \"Rather Be\" helped the group ride New Eyes into 2016, yielding an additional pair of singles that kept Clean Bandit on the U.K. charts.\r\n\nIn late 2016, Amin-Smith parted ways with the band, days before they released the single \"Rockabye,\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Isy6kedDrgPYoTS1dazA9\">Sean Paul</a> and Anne-Marie on vocals. The track became their second U.K. number one and broke into the Billboard Top Ten, later receiving platinum certification throughout Europe and in the U.S. and Australia. Clean Bandit followed with another chart-topping collaboration, \"Symphony\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xylc3o4UrD53lo9CvFvVg\">Zara Larsson</a>, and the Top Five single \"I Miss You\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0ZED1XzwlLHW4ZaG4lOT6m\">Julia Michaels</a>. In 2018, the trio secured their fourth hit with the summer single \"Solo,\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:6S2OmqARrzebs0tKUEyXyp\">Demi Lovato</a>. \"Baby\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6CwfuxIqcltXDGjfZsMd9A\">Marina and the Diamonds</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4V8Sr092TqfHkfAA5fXXqG\">Luis Fonsi</a> arrived shortly before the release of the group's sophomore full-length, What Is Love? In addition to the previously released hit singles, the album also included appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0X2BH1fck6amBIoJhDVmmJ\">Ellie Goulding</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5CCwRZC6euC8Odo6y9X8jr\">Rita Ora</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1G9G7WwrXka3Z1r7aIDjI7\">OutKast</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:2ht3wxeT69CzyKFChNnNAB\">Big Boi</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2JyWXPbkqI5ZJa3gwqVa0c\">Craig David</a>, and many more. A 2020 collaboration with rapper <a href=\"spotify:artist:6fWVd57NKTalqvmjRd2t8Z\">24kGoldn</a> yielded the Top Ten U.K. single \"Tick Tock.\" More tracks arrived in 2021, including \"Higher\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6ASri4ePR7RlsvIQgWPJpS\">Iann Dior</a> and \"Drive\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1mKz1znhUcO9yz6Xs0Yqj6\">Topic</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4ktBrNjagCGftyuBLJkATq\">Wes Nelson</a>. ~ David Jeffries & Neil Z.

        "biography": "With their light, airy melodies and meticulously crafted, clean arrangements that appealed to a variety of audiences, the Carpenters stood in direct contrast to the excessive, gaudy pop/rock of the '70s. Yet, they became one of the most popular artists of the decade, winning four Grammy Awards, and scoring 12 Top Ten hits, and three number one singles, including the classic \"(They Long to Be) Close to You\" off 1970's Close to You. <a href=\"spotify:artist:36RONzYVz7gBzAI1k6kot1\">Karen Carpenter</a>'s calm, pretty voice was the most distinctive element of their music, settling in perfectly amidst the precise, lush arrangements provided by her brother <a href=\"spotify:artist:7slnlqXyKCLVEirP005Q2n\">Richard</a>. Though their popularity began to fade as the '70s progressed, the duo continued to make music together until <a href=\"spotify:artist:36RONzYVz7gBzAI1k6kot1\">Karen</a>'s tragic death in 1983. \r\n\nThe Carpenters formed in the late '60s in Downey, California, after their family moved from their native New Haven, Connecticut. <a href=\"spotify:artist:7slnlqXyKCLVEirP005Q2n\">Richard</a> had played piano with a cocktail jazz trio in a handful of local Connecticut nightclubs. Once the family had moved to California, he began to study piano while he supported <a href=\"spotify:artist:36RONzYVz7gBzAI1k6kot1\">Karen</a> in a trio that featured Wes Jacobs (tuba/bass). With Jacobs and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7slnlqXyKCLVEirP005Q2n\">Richard</a> forming her backup band, <a href=\"spotify:artist:36RONzYVz7gBzAI1k6kot1\">Karen</a> was signed to the local California record label <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Magic+Lamp%22\">Magic Lamp</a>, which released two unsuccessful singles by the singer. The trio won a Battle of the Bands contest at the Hollywood Bowl in 1966, which led to a record contract with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22RCA%22\">RCA</a>. Signing under the name <a href=\"spotify:artist:7slnlqXyKCLVEirP005Q2n\">the Richard Carpenter Trio</a>, the group cut four songs that were never released. Jacobs left the band at the beginning of 1968.\r\n\nFollowing Jacobs' departure, the siblings formed <a href=\"spotify:artist:6PWLmgeCatbK7dhDQ6A1oQ\">Spectrum</a> with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7slnlqXyKCLVEirP005Q2n\">Richard</a>'s college friend <a href=\"spotify:artist:4jmVG1bMuHIUGZJ13EJ9TT\">John Bettis</a>. <a href=\"spotify:artist:6PWLmgeCatbK7dhDQ6A1oQ\">Spectrum</a> fell apart by the end of the year, but the Carpenters continued performing as a duo. The pair recorded some demos at the house of Los Angeles session musician <a href=\"spotify:artist:5OGnIiN0VDdkwDTSXF0b56\">Joe Osborn</a>; the tape was directed toward <a href=\"spotify:artist:1PqdKx88nAgPolRy079lMl\">Herb Alpert</a>, the head of <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22A%26M+Records%22\">A&M Records</a>, who signed the duo to his record label in early 1969.\r\n\nOffering, the Carpenters' first album, was released in November 1969. Neither Offering nor the accompanying single, a cover of <a href=\"spotify:artist:3WrFJ7ztbogyGnTHbHJFl2\">the Beatles</a>' \"Ticket to Ride,\" made a big impression. However, the Carpenters' fortunes changed with their second single, a version of <a href=\"spotify:artist:35y7CZMg7jbG8Q96JY7dyC\">Burt Bacharach</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4SneDShROaEhPgKm12KZ3W\">Hal David</a>'s \"(They Long to Be) Close to You.\" Taken from the album Close to You, the single became the group's first number one, spending four weeks on the top of the U.S. charts. \"Close to You\" became an international hit, beginning a five-year period where the duo was one of the most popular recording acts in the world. During that period, the Carpenters won two Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist of 1970, and had an impressive string of Top Ten hits, including \"Rainy Days and Mondays,\" \"Superstar,\" \"Hurting Each Other,\" \"Goodbye to Love,\" \"Yesterday Once More,\" and \"Top of the World.\"\r\n\nAfter 1975's number four hit \"Only Yesterday,\" the group's popularity began to decline. For the latter half of the '70s, the duo were plagued by personal problems. <a href=\"spotify:artist:7slnlqXyKCLVEirP005Q2n\">Richard</a> had become addicted to prescription drugs; in 1978, he entered a recovery clinic, kicking his habit. <a href=\"spotify:artist:36RONzYVz7gBzAI1k6kot1\">Karen</a>, meanwhile, became afflicted with anorexia nervosa, a disease she suffered from for the rest of her life. On top of their health problems, the group's singles had stopped reaching the Top Ten and by 1978, they weren't even reaching the Top 40. Consequently, <a href=\"spotify:artist:36RONzYVz7gBzAI1k6kot1\">Karen</a> decided to pursue a solo career, recording a solo album in 1979 with <a href=\"spotify:artist:63SAbg9DkZabjTQUJBUAw5\">Phil Ramone</a>; the record was never completed and she returned to the Carpenters later that year. The reunited duo released their last album of new material, Made in America, in 1981. The album marked a commercial comeback, as \"Touch Me When We're Dancing\" made it to number 16 on the charts. However, <a href=\"spotify:artist:36RONzYVz7gBzAI1k6kot1\">Karen</a>'s health continued to decline, forcing the duo out of the spotlight. On February 4, 1983, <a href=\"spotify:artist:36RONzYVz7gBzAI1k6kot1\">Karen</a> was found unconscious at her parents' home in Downey; she died in the hospital that morning from cardiac arrest, caused by her anorexia.\r\n\nAfter <a href=\"spotify:artist:36RONzYVz7gBzAI1k6kot1\">Karen</a>'s death, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7slnlqXyKCLVEirP005Q2n\">Richard Carpenter</a> concentrated on production work and assembling various compilations of the Carpenters' recorded work. In 1987, he released a solo album called Time, which featured guest appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:5zaXYwewAXedKNCff45U5l\">Dusty Springfield</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2JSjCHK79gdaiPWdKiNUNp\">Dionne Warwick</a>. More posthumous albums followed including 1989's Lovelines, which featured unreleased Carpenters tracks next to curated solo tracks by <a href=\"spotify:artist:36RONzYVz7gBzAI1k6kot1\">Karen</a>. As Time Goes By also arrived in Japan in 2001. In 2018, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7slnlqXyKCLVEirP005Q2n\">Richard</a> oversaw the production of Carpenters with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Recorded at the famed Abbey Road Studios, the album featured many of the duo's original songs reworked with added orchestration by the London-based <a href=\"spotify:artist:0MvSBMGRQJY3mRwIbJsqF1\">Royal Philharmonic</a>. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi",

No stranger to defying expectations, Dissimulation received critical acclaim. Clash labelled it “an excellent body of work”; “he’s absolutely smashed it” proclaimed Metro.\n\nOther labels and artists want a piece of the KSI pie too: just look to the success of his features on S1mba’s Loose and Nathan Dawe’s BRIT nominated Lighter.\n\nWith his second album out now, a 2021 tour which sold out in seconds including a headline show at The SSE Arena Wembley, the launch of his own label and a single with Craig David (Really Love), Anne-Marie (Don’t Play) and YUNGBLUD (Patience), KSI has proven that music is very much his domain.\n\nKSI brings with him the unrelenting work ethic and infectious energy which YouTube instilled in him. Despite his debut’s success, he’s certain Dissimulation just scratched the surface: the next record, he’s clear, will showcase his artistry’s further progression again. Given FAULT Magazine described KSI as “one of 2019’s biggest success stories - “an emergent hip-hop star” said The i - all eyes will be on his follow up. KSI’s task - writes The Observer - is “not just to make “YouTube rap” but the real thing”. Their verdict? “Mission accomplished.”",

        "biography": "Without raising his voice, Gunna is one of rap's most successful artists. Almost slurring and sometimes verging on a stutter, he nonetheless displayed the poise of a proven veteran from his entry on <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>'s \"Floyd Mayweather\" (2016) through his early mixtapes and the Top Ten <a href=\"spotify:artist:5f7VJjfbwm532GiveGC0ZK\">Lil Baby</a> collaboration Drip Harder (2018). Gunna's high commercial standing has been affirmed with projects such as Drip or Drown 2 (2019), WUNNA (2020), and the compilation Slime Language 2 (2021), followed by DS4Ever (2022), A Gift & a Curse (2023), and One of Wun (2024). Each of those sets either topped or nearly topped the Billboard 200, boosted by hit singles like \"Drip Too Hard,\" \"Too Easy,\" and \"FukUMean.\"\r\n\nThe College Park, Georgia-based rapper, born Sergio Kitchens, became interested in music and rapping as a hobby in his early teens. He got more serious about the possibility of a career in hip-hop around 2016, when he was introduced to Atlanta MC <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a> by a mutual friend. Before long, Gunna was in the studio hopping on <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>'s \"Floyd Mayweather,\" where he lent a verse alongside superstars <a href=\"spotify:artist:13y7CgLHjMVRMDqxdx0Xdo\">Gucci Mane</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY\">Travis Scott</a>. A number 41 hit on Billboard's R&B/hip-hop chart, the single was enough to propel Gunna to relative fame. He was soon signed to <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22YSL%22\">YSL</a> imprint. By late 2016, he'd released the Drip Season mixtape. Its sequel, Drip Season 2, came out in 2017, and an EP produced entirely by Wheezy, Drip or Drown, followed in 2019.\r\n\nGunna hit the Billboard 200 for the first time with early 2018's Drip Season 3, featuring guest appearances from <a href=\"spotify:artist:6icQOAFXDZKsumw3YXyusw\">Lil Yachty</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4O15NlyKLIASxsJ0PrXPfz\">Lil Uzi Vert</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>, which entered the chart at number 55. Within ten months, the rapper returned beside <a href=\"spotify:artist:5f7VJjfbwm532GiveGC0ZK\">Lil Baby</a> with Drip Harder, which went to number four, highlighted by \"Drip Too Hard,\" his first platinum-certified recording. At this point, Gunna was fully primed for a debut album, and with a verse on <a href=\"spotify:artist:4iHNK0tOyZPYnBU7nGAgpQ\">Mariah Carey</a>'s \"Stay Long Love You,\" he had even made his first big genre-crossover move. Long in the making, Drip or Drown 2 was released in February 2019 and duly trumped Gunna's previous placements by entering the Billboard 200 at number three. In April 2020, \"Quarantine Clean,\" a collaborative single from Gunna, <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:002HSjuWsGMinkXTa7JcRp\">Turbo</a>, surfaced with a hook that referenced the global quarantines brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gunna's sophomore set, WUNNA, arrived the next month. Previewed by woozy trap singles \"Skybox\" and \"Wunna,\" the project featured collaborations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY\">Travis Scott</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>, among others, and entered the Billboard 200 at number one.\r\n\nHe scored his second chart-topper in 2021 with the <a href=\"spotify:artist:1xr2G8Hlx4QWmT9HaUbmoO\">Young Stoner Life</a> compilation Slime Language 2. The set featured <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY\">Travis Scott</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4O15NlyKLIASxsJ0PrXPfz\">Lil Uzi Vert</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0c173mlxpT3dSFRgMO8XPh\">Big Sean</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2p1fiYHYiXz9qi0JJyxBzN\">Skepta</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0fA0VVWsXO9YnASrzqfmYu\">Kid Cudi</a>, and over a dozen more famous friends. In 2022, the rapper returned with his third studio album DS4Ever, a spiritual continuation of the Drip Season series of tapes, which became Gunna's second solo number one-charting debut. The single \"Bread & Butter\" preceded the 2023 studio album A Gift & a Curse, which reached number three. After he was featured on <a href=\"spotify:artist:002HSjuWsGMinkXTa7JcRp\">Turbo</a>'s \"Bachelor\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:408vMm7y1227ASq7GmWygZ\">Sarz</a>'s \"Happiness,\" Gunna began his 2024 solo campaign with \"Bittersweet,\" and continued with One of Wun, a number two hit supported by the singles \"PradaDem\" and \"WhatsApp (Wassam).\" ~ Fred Thomas & Andy Kellman",

        "biography": "Dread Mar-I is a charting, best-selling Argentine reggae singer, songwriter, and bandleader. His sensual, passionate vocal delivery ranges over a style that combines deep roots reggae with the sweetness of lovers rock. Dread was born Mariano Javier Castro in Quequén, Argentina in January of 1978. When he was seven years old, his family moved to Maipú, a suburb of Buenos Aires. Besides going to school, he worked in his father's bakery. His interest in music, reggae, and Rastafarianism in particular came about during these tender years, as he heard <a href=\"spotify:artist:2QsynagSdAqZj3U9HgDzjD\">Bob Marley</a>'s music in the neighborhood. He graduated high school and worked, honing his musical chops at night.\r\n\nHis first professional gig was as lead singer of the Reggae Messengers. After three years, Dread put together a band and went solo. His debut album, Jah Guia, was initially issued independently, but garnered wide attention when a couple of enterprising DJs decided to play it. His gigs got larger and soon the major labels came calling. <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Sony%2FBMG%22\">Sony/BMG</a> signed him and reissued Jah Guia across Latin America in 2006. Sales were better than anyone expected. He was asked by renowned reggae big band <a href=\"spotify:artist:2ST5XwWB4uXGKk2NXP8DUI\">Los Cafres</a> to be a stable opener for them (and sing in their backing chorus), including a massive show at Luna Park, which greatly expanded the singer's profile. Later that year he and his band performed at the first annual <a href=\"spotify:artist:2QsynagSdAqZj3U9HgDzjD\">Bob Marley</a> Day festival at Luna Park with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6uSKeCyQEhvPC2NODgiqFE\">the Wailers</a> and Peter Tosh Band. Working with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2ST5XwWB4uXGKk2NXP8DUI\">Los Cafres</a> and headlining his own gigs had their advantages; because of the attention -- and the money -- he was able to record a second album with his own band, Los Guerreros del Rey. It was released in 2007. The following year, with the release of the album Amor-es, Dread became an in-demand attraction. He played 70-plus shows nationally and toured abroad as well. By the time he released Viví en Do in 2010, he was the most popular reggae singer in Argentina, and had established an international following that reached across most of Latin America. \r\n\nHis reputation also extended into the Caribbean: 2011's Tranquilo was a collaborative album with no less a talent than Jamaica's <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Vszg64mczF1dWEcW2dU5W\">Luciano</a>. With his new backing band, Warriors of the King, he took his show to Mexico and the United States. In late 2011 and early 2012, Dread worked at Panda and TAMS studios and delivered Transparente, a record that took him onto the streaming charts in the reggae, tropical, and Latin categories. It also revealed his increasing studio savvy -- he mixed it himself. Its success also made his Luna Park shows all but impossible to get into; tickets sold out months in advance. He went back to the studio and issued the hit single \"Nada\" (backed by a Jamaican chorus) in early 2014. He followed it with the video single \"No Te Asustes Ahora,\" which netted hundreds of thousands of views in its first weeks on YouTube. As a result, the 17-song full-length En el Sendero went gold. \r\n\nIn 2016, Dread celebrated his tenth anniversary as a recording artist with a show at the massive El Planetario in Palermo, Buenos Aires. The price of admission was donations of food, clothing, or cash for the homeless. An expansive audio-video package entitled 10 Anos -- featuring both new and catalog songs as well as a documentary -- was released and climbed the streaming and download charts. The recording also featured the studio track \"Hoja en Blanco,\" a revisioned vallenato standard. A demo version of it appeared on the artist's Facebook page and garnered over five million views. ~ Thom Jurek, Rovi",

The promise of something new, when it isn’t real yet, hangs rich and sweet in the air. That millisecond moment in time, suspended in vast suggestion, where there is every opportunity for a shift in trajectory. Small or seismic. You choose.&#34; – NIKI",

        "biography": "Richard Clayderman was born in Paris in 1957 and has become one of the most successful pianists of all time. At the age of twelve he was accepted into the prestigious ‘Conservatoire de Paris’, obtaining the first prize in piano at sixteen. During the 1970’s, Richard Clayderman worked as a session musician for many famous French singers but his life changed dramatically upon meeting Olivier Toussaint and Paul de Senneville in October 1976. Paul de Senneville had written a romantic ballad following the birth of his daughter, Adeline and, with his partner Olivier Toussaint, were searching for a talented pianist to play it. Richard was shown the piano score, but rather than play it immediately, took it home to perfect his performance and auditioned the following day. ‘Ballade Pour Adeline’ earned great acclaim firstly in France, Germany, Spain and by 1979, worldwide. The track has since sold an astonishing 22 millions copies in 38 countries.  \n\nDubbed ‘The Prince of Romance’ by Nancy Reagan, Richard Clayderman enjoys a career that has spanned six decades. In that time he has sold over 90 million albums worldwide and recorded over 1,400 titles in his trademark romantic style, a broad repertoire that encompasses original compositions as well as classical and pop standards that are enjoyed the world over.",

Infused with her vibrant personality, her songs offer an innovative take on pop and R&amp;B, shimmering with the euphoria of South African amapiano, and an otherworldly approach to production that makes every track feel like something totally new. The Johannesburg native introduced herself internationally with her debut “Getting Late” featuring Kooldrink, and now “Been Thinking” and “To Last,” her new singles via Epic Records, push her artistry forward and solidify her versatility as she bounds toward her goal. But despite her big dreams, Tyla is doing her best to remain carefree. She never anticipated that “Getting Late” would permeate beyond South Africa, much less reach the U.S., but realized something was happening when people all over the world were making TikToks to the song, eventually resulting in millions of streams. Tyla’s emotionally rich music began when she was just 12, penning songs in her diary, which led to writing and singing more seriously as a high schooler. Ever since, she’s been guided by her intuition, which has her primed to build out her fan base and maximize her reach. She’s focused on the year ahead, performing and crafting her debut studio album, with the same intention from when she began. Signed to Epic Records through a joint venture with Johannesburg/New York-based Fax Records, and co-managed by We Make Music and Africa Creative Agency, Tyla is poised to achieve international dominance with style, soul, and spirit.",

        "biography": "Canadian rapper and vocalist Drake has retained a bigger-than-life commercial presence shortly after he hit the scene in 2006, whether with his own chart-topping releases or with a long string of guest appearances on hits by the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:13ubrt8QOOCPljQ2FL1Kca\">A$AP Rocky</a>. Thanks to his introspective rap style, his sensitive R&B crooning, and his golden touch with songwriting, each one of his albums -- from 2011's Take Care to 2018's trap-influenced Scorpion -- topped charts worldwide, and singles like the Grammy-winning \"Hotline Bling\" and many of his mixtapes did too. As his star rose, he helped others along, sponsoring <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a>'s early work, starting the <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22OVO+Sound%22\">OVO Sound</a> label, and giving features on his records to up-and-coming acts. By the second decade of his career, Drake's constant chart domination, his Grammy wins and nominations, and his meme-worthy cultural presence made him one of the world's most popular musicians, and the release of albums like 2022's Honestly, Nevermind and 2023's For All the Dogs became cultural events. A heavily publicized feud with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a> in 2024 yielded a string of diss tracks, including \"Push-Ups\" and \"Family Matters,\" both of which hit the Top Ten of the Hot 100.\r\n\nInitially known for his role as Jimmy Brooks on Degrassi: The Next Generation, the Toronto-born Aubrey Drake Graham stepped out as a rapper and singer with pop appeal in 2006, when he initiated a series of mixtapes. A year later, despite being unsigned, he scored major exposure when his cocky and laid-back track, \"Replacement Girl\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:2iojnBLj0qIMiKPvVhLnsH\">Trey Songz</a>, was featured on BET's 106 & Park program as its \"Joint of the Day.\" He raised his profile throughout the next several months by popping up on countless mixtapes and remixes, and as rumors swirled about contract offers from labels, he gradually became one of the most talked-about artists in the industry. It did not hurt that he had support from the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>. \r\n\nBy the end of June 2009, \"Best I Ever Had,\" a promotional single, had climbed to number two on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. After a fierce bidding war, Drake signed with Universal Motown in late summer and released an EP, So Far Gone, made up of songs from his popular mixtape of the same title. It peaked at number six on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and won a 2010 Juno Award for Rap Recording of the Year. Thank Me Later, a full-length featuring collaborations with the <a href=\"spotify:artist:2qk9voo8llSGYcZ6xrBzKx\">Kings of Leon</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1W3FSF1BLpY3hlVIgvenLz\">the-Dream</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, was issued through <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Young+Money%22\">Young Money</a> in June 2010. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Still, the artist felt his debut was rushed, so its follow-up arrived in November 2011 with the title Take Care, referencing the increased time and effort put into the album's creation. Receiving critical acclaim, Grammy Awards, and the number one slot on the U.S. Billboard 200, Take Care cemented Drake's place as one of Canada's biggest exports. \r\n\nWhile on tour in 2012, Drake announced that he had started work on what would be his third studio album; Nothing Was the Same was released the following September. It spawned many singles, topped charts around the world, was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, and was nominated for a Best Rap Album Grammy Award. Soon after the album's release, Drake hit the road on an extended tour, took part in some collaborations, and released a few singles, including the Grammy-nominated \"0 to 100/The Catch Up.\" His next release was planned as a free mixtape before <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Cash+Money%22\">Cash Money</a> decided they would rather charge for it. The decidedly downbeat If You're Reading This It's Too Late was released in February 2015 and debuted at number one, while all 17 of its songs entered the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \r\n\nIn late summer 2015, Drake released a trio of new tracks on his SoundCloud page. One of them, the <a href=\"spotify:artist:7JLwBH0X2G8tgHceqvOu5B\">Timmy Thomas</a>-sampling \"Hotline Bling,\" became a Top Five pop hit in Canada and the U.S. and something of a cultural phenomenon. Later that year, Drake hit the studio with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a> for a six-day session that yielded the mixtape What a Time to Be Alive. Upon the album's September release, it became Drake's second recording of the year to debut at number one. After issuing three singles in the beginning months of 2016, his fourth album, Views, arrived in April and debuted at number one. It revolved lyrically around his hometown of Toronto and featured production by longtime cohorts <a href=\"spotify:artist:4vQEj0zCIa6CvDruKZCLNk\">Noah \"40\" Shebib</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RQnTQM6OQd8dTUDF7UsT7\">Boi-1da</a>, among others. Late that year, Drake issued another trio of singles, including the chart-topping \"Fake Love.\" They preceded the playlist More Life, released the following March with appearances from <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0VRj0yCOv2FXJNP47XQnx5\">Quavo</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY\">Travis Scott</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>. The release became his seventh consecutive chart-topping album.\r\n\nAt the start of 2018, Drake issued the two-song EP Scary Hours. Both \"Diplomatic Immunity\" and \"God's Plan\" hit the Top Ten, the latter becoming his second solo chart-topper. It served as a precursor to his fifth album, the two-disc set Scorpion, which was broken into a rap side and an R&B side that featured the hit single \"Nice for What.\" It was released in June and instantly went platinum, while also breaking records for most streams in a single day. At the 61st Grammy Awards, Drake took home the prize for Best Rap Song for \"God's Plan.\" \r\n\nIn 2019, Drake raided the vaults for two archival releases: an official streaming release of the So Far Gone mixtape, and the Billboard 200-topping Care Package, which rounded up tracks that were leaked, discarded, or used as teasers, dating back to the Take Care era. Drake collected two Grammy nominations for the 2020 ceremonies, one for Best Rap Song with his <a href=\"spotify:artist:1sBkRIssrMs1AbVkOJbc7a\">Rick Ross</a> collaboration \"Gold Roses\" and another for Best R&B Song with his <a href=\"spotify:artist:7bXgB6jMjp9ATFy66eO08Z\">Chris Brown</a>-assisted \"No Guidance.\" That same year, he released another mixtape made up of demos and singles titled Dark Lane Demo Tapes. One of the tracks was \"Toosie Slide,\" his third song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making him the first male artist to accomplish that feat. \r\n\nDrake followed up with a slew of guest spots on songs by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QHgL1lAIqAw0HtD7YldmP\">DJ Khaled</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2EMAnMvWE2eb56ToJVfCWs\">Bryson Tiller</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0p4ViyfJUTW0IT4SCBLexf\">Drakeo the Ruler</a>, then issued the \"Laugh Now Cry Later\" single in late 2020. The <a href=\"spotify:artist:3hcs9uc56yIGFCSy9leWe7\">Lil Durk</a>-featured track was touted as the first single from Certified Lover Boy, Drake's soon-to-be-released sixth official album. It didn't materialize as quickly as planned due to his knee surgery and recovery that precluded any work. Instead, an EP titled Scary Hours 2 was issued in early 2021, and Drake appeared on songs by <a href=\"spotify:artist:6oMuImdp5ZcFhWP0ESe6mG\">Migos</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6loSmkIxQDRyetkJFNJHBr\">Smiley</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6Xgp2XMz1fhVYe7i6yNAax\">Trippie Redd</a>. Sporting a controversial Damien Hirst-designed cover, the trap-inspired CLB was finally released that September and featured appearances by a who's who of the rap scene past and present including <a href=\"spotify:artist:1sBkRIssrMs1AbVkOJbc7a\">Rick Ross</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5f7VJjfbwm532GiveGC0ZK\">Lil Baby</a>, and many more. Like the five previous records, it topped the album charts in Canada and the U.S. \r\n\nDrake stayed busy throughout 2022, appearing as a guest on albums by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hlmm7s2ICUX0LVIhVFlZQ\">Gunna</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, collaborating with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QHgL1lAIqAw0HtD7YldmP\">DJ Khaled</a>, and signing a deal with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Universal%22\">Universal</a> for one of the largest contracts in music business history. It took until June of that year for Drake to release any music under his own name, and when he did it was the house music-inspired Honestly, Nevermind. Though the album featured a large number of producers, most prominently <a href=\"spotify:artist:4vQEj0zCIa6CvDruKZCLNk\">Noah \"40\" Shebib</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6wMr4zKPrrR0UVz08WtUWc\">Black Coffee</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7CCjtD0hCK005Bvg2WG1a7\">Carnage</a>, the only other rapper to appear was <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a>. The collaboration with the latter was built out into a full-length album titled Her Loss. Released in late 2022, the record relied on trap beats, melancholy synth washes, and a surprising number of disses. It topped both the Canadian Albums and Billboard 200 charts. In April 2023, he reached number two on the Hot 100 with \"Search & Rescue,\" a track that sampled Kim Kardashian. After branching out into poetry with his first book, Titles Ruin Everything, in July, Drake returned with his eighth album, For All the Dogs. It featured guests ranging from <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">J. Cole</a> to <a href=\"spotify:artist:0fGcIStdT1OpFFhOC7Wp36\">Teezo Touchdown</a>, and delivered a set of aggressive and melancholy trap songs. It was issued on October 6, the same day he announced a year-long sabbatical from music to focus on health issues. \r\n\nIn 2024, Drake became embroiled in a well-publicized feud with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">J. Cole</a>. After <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">Cole</a> had named the three as the \"big three\" greatest rappers in modern hip-hop, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a> asserted that he was the only one during his guest verse on <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>'s song \"Like That,\" which topped the Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">Cole</a> then criticized <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a> on his song \"7 Minute Drill,\" which was met with a poor reception; <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">Cole</a> apologized for the song and removed it from streaming services. In April, Drake released two diss tracks against <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a>, \"Push Ups\" and \"Taylor Made Freestyle,\" with the former reaching number ten on the Hot 100. <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a> responded with the vitriolic \"Euphoria\" and a track posted to Instagram titled \"6:16 in L.A.\" Drake's \"Family Matters\" appeared in May, hitting number six on the Hot 100. It was promptly followed by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a>'s Alchemist-produced \"Meet the Grahams\" and party-ready \"Not Like Us.\" Also that May, Drake responded with \"The Heart, Pt. 6,\" a reference to <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a>'s ongoing \"The Heart\" song series. ~ Tim Sendra, Rovi",

        "biography": "Being Dead: America&#39;s #1 sweethearts. With their distinct blend of catchy yet unpredictable songwriting, undeniable harmonies, and unbridled spirit, Falcon Bitch and Gumball dole out boo-boos whilst also kissing them better.\n\nAside from musical achievements, the two took home first place at the 2015 Golden Road Haunted Wine Run 5K Vineyard Stomp in Surry County, NC. The win prompted them to buckle down and train for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro where they swept the competition, returning with 5 medals and the respect of a nation. Inspired by the incredible flavors of their travels, they took to the kitchen for what was their most sensational project to date: their signature restaurant La Piss Tarte in 2017. 2 Michelin stars and a Pulitzer prize later, the duo find themselves sitting atop a mountain of wealth generously donated to a charity of your choice.\n\nBut don’t be fooled! Though they are extremely benevolent, they do withhold a small portion of their fortune to indulge in their true passion: American legacy muscle car restoration. Can you blame them? ‘Muscle cars’ redefined performance driving in the mid 20th century and is a term that was coined in 1966 to describe a group of American-made, two-door sports coupes with powerful engines. Here to stoke the coals and resurrect the legacy is Being Dead whose passion roars incessantly – not unlike a Chrysler second-generation Hemi. (When the 426 Hemi landed on the scene in 1964, it shook up the competition.)",

It&#39;s important to me that the song&#39;s message comes across, touches people, and inspires reflection. However, each person should interpret my songs in their individual way.&#34; – Linda Elys\nSwiss singer-/songwriter Linda Elys had dreamt of standing on a big stage and singing her own songs since she was a child. As a teenager, she began honing her voice, taught herself to play guitar, and soon performed in local bars and clubs. Linda quickly became a local favorite due to her distinctive and moving voice. At 19, she gathered all her courage and auditioned for &#34;The Voice of Germany&#34;, then known by her birth name Linda Elsener. She made it to the finals, and although she didn&#39;t win, it was clear to Linda that this was the start of her own musical project.\nBack in Switzerland, she found Benjamin Schmid, aka Bnji, as the perfect musical partner to produce her debut EP. Together they developed and produced Linda&#39;s demos in the studio, including the lead single &#34;House On Fire&#34;, which was released on October 13th, 2023 to great acclaim. The song is featured on Linda Elys debut EP called &#34;Maggie&#34;, released on March 22nd 2024. The five songs on the EP tell personal stories from her life, addressing the challenges of growing up. The production skillfully balances between modern pop and folk. The singer-songwriter infuses the songs with a unique intensity and depth through her touching and expressive voice.",

He favored dancehall the most, but soca and hip-hop were important too, all of which exploded out the speakers of his DJ brother. His brother was also involved in recording Collie's demo track \"Come Around,\" an infectious song that blew up in Europe and topped the charts in the U.K. before it came to Jamaica. As the marijuana anthem was climbing the JA charts all the way up to number one, rapper <a href=\"spotify:artist:1YfEcTuGvBQ8xSD1f53UnK\">Busta Rhymes</a> cut his own unauthorized remix, which increased the track's presence on urban American radio. Guest vocals on a remix of <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m\">Beyoncé</a>'s \"Ring the Alarm\" began his relationship with the <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Sony%22\">Sony</a> label, while hooking up with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4Q5sPmM8j4SpMqL4UA1DtS\">Lil' Flip</a> for the rapper's I Need Mine album kept spreading the Collie Buddz name on the streets. Everything was in place as his second single, \"Mamacita,\" and his self-titled debut album were both released by <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Sony%22\">Sony</a> in the summer of 2007. In 2011 he returned with the free download EP Playback. In 2014 he released the singles \"Light It Up\" plus \"Yesterday\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:31IZdHrCZ5pRhLz4zBxN3o\">Riff Raff</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG\">Snoop Dogg</a>, while the release of \"Prescription\" followed in 2015. Following an extended hiatus, Buddz returned in 2017 with his second full-length album, Good Life, featuring guest appearances from <a href=\"spotify:artist:1peH5tSqnYm8W6Bo3I5egE\">Kat Dahlia</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5jrXeH1yhdshRakLMBtkdO\">Kreesha Turner</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2QLM9IFaHBtB16b8ZDaA3A\">P-Lo</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3R32p7BtvSASZmUMSIZQnE\">Jody Highroller</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG\">Snoop Dogg</a>.

It’s this determination to live authentically and to write intuitively that makes Indy such a compelling songwriter.\n\nAs inspired by writers like Ocean Vuong, Frank O’Hara and Alex Dimitrov as she is Bon Iver, Mk.gee and Holly Humberstone, Indy acquits herself as a hugely evocative lyricist on debut track Threads, capable of conjuring a tidal wave of emotion in a single image.\n\nBringing a poet’s perspective to songwriting, and fostering a powerful sense of universality while tracing her own deeply-personal emotional journey, Threads is an enthralling introduction to a truly remarkable storyteller. As Indy explains, “I&#39;ve always had a very distinct voice but now, at 25, I finally feel I know exactly what I’m trying to say.”",

        "biography": "Alex O'Connor, also known as Rex Orange County, is a singer/songwriter known for his literate, quirky brand of bedroom pop that combines jazz, hip-hop, and soul influences. O'Connor was still a teenager when he first gained attention online in 2015 for his self-produced album bcos u will never b free. He built upon his viral buzz with 2017's Apricot Princess, which found him further expanding his sound. The set cracked the Top Ten of Billboard's Independent Albums chart and paved the way for his even more ambitious, jazz-inflected 2019 effort PONY. A commercial breakthrough, PONY catapulted him into the Top Five of the main album charts in several countries, including the U.K. and U.S. In 2022, Rex Orange County's fourth full-length, the <a href=\"spotify:artist:4V8LLVI7PbaPR0K2TGSxFF\">Tyler, The Creator</a>-featuring Who Cares?, went all the way to number one in the U.K. and New Zealand. He followed it with the more stripped-back and personal The Alexander Technique in 2024. Its lead-single title track addressed near life-long struggles with mental health and chronic pain.\r\n\nBorn in 1998 and raised in the village of Grayshott along the border of Hampshire and Surrey, O'Connor grew up singing in the school choir and developed a love of pop, listening to a mix of classic and contemporary artists including <a href=\"spotify:artist:1dfeR4HaWDbWqFHLkxsg1d\">Queen</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7guDJrEfX3qb6FEbdPA5qi\">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7oPftvlwr6VrsViSDV7fJY\">Green Day</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3jOstUTkEu2JkjvRdBA5Gu\">Weezer</a>. A self-taught drummer, he gained entrance to the BRIT School in London as a teenager. While studying there, he also sang and played guitar, and picked up piano and production software skills while working on his first album. At 17, with the \"O.C.\" derived from O'Connor, he used the Rex Orange County moniker to self-release bcos u will never b free for streaming in 2015. \r\n\nAs word of his distinctive style spread, he followed it up with songs like 2016's \"Uno\" and early 2017's \"Best Friend\" and \"Sunflower\" before releasing his second self-made LP, Apricot Princess, that April. <a href=\"spotify:artist:4V8LLVI7PbaPR0K2TGSxFF\">Tyler, The Creator</a> was a fan by that time, and featured Rex Orange County on two tracks from his Flower Boy album, released in July 2017. The following year, O'Connor finished second in the BBC Sound of 2018 poll behind Norwegian singer <a href=\"spotify:artist:4TrraAsitQKl821DQY42cZ\">Sigrid</a>. \r\n\nFebruary 2019 saw the arrival of the bittersweet Valentine's Day-themed single \"New House,\" which was followed in September by \"10/10.\" Rex Orange County's third album, PONY, arrived in October that year and found him digging even deeper into his '70s singer/songwriter and jazz influences. It also landed him at number one on both the Billboard Top Rock and Alternative Albums charts. In 2020, O'Connor celebrated the five-year anniversary of his debut, bcos u will never b free, with a special vinyl release. He also issued the concert LP Live at Radio City Music Hall. The single \"Keep It Up\" appeared in early 2022 ahead of the release of his fourth long-player, Who Cares?, which arrived later that March. Recorded in Amsterdam with longtime associate <a href=\"spotify:artist:4gHcu2JoaXJ0mV4aNPCd7N\">Benny Sings</a>, the album also featured a reunion with rapper <a href=\"spotify:artist:4V8LLVI7PbaPR0K2TGSxFF\">Tyler, The Creator</a> on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs-charting \"Open a Window.\" Who Cares? became a pop-chart breakthrough, hitting number three in the U.S. and Canada, four in Australia, and number five in the United Kingdom. \r\n\nO'Connor followed that success with what he claimed was the album he'd always wanted to release. More stripped-down and autobiographical, September 2024's self-produced The Alexander Technique delved into personal experiences with things like chronic pain and mental health, as indicated by the piano-based lead single of the same name. ~ Marcy Donelson, Rovi",

        "biography": "Controversial rapper Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy (aka XXXTentacion) played fast and loose when it came to genres, often incorporating elements of punk rock, hip-hop, R&B, and heavy metal. In the late 2010s, he experienced a quick rise with his dark and emotionally intense content, scoring a number one album with 2018's ?. Months later, at the peak of his popularity, he was shot and killed.\r\n\nBorn in South Florida, Onfroy had a troubled upbringing, often getting into violent situations; his mother couldn't cope with raising him alone, so he was often forced to stay with various relatives as a result. At a very young age, Onfroy was sent to a juvenile detention center after committing armed robbery; it was there that he met friend and longtime collaborator <a href=\"spotify:artist:2rhFzFmezpnW82MNqEKVry\">Ski Mask the Slump God</a>. After his release, both Onfroy and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2rhFzFmezpnW82MNqEKVry\">Ski Mask</a> decided to get clean and pursue a career in music, setting up the Florida rap crew <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Members+Only%22\">Members Only</a> in the process. \r\n\nIn 2014, Onfroy uploaded his first track to SoundCloud, \"Vice City,\" which quickly racked up hundreds of thousands of streams. Later the same year, he released two EPs, The Fall and Ice Hotel; the broad array of genres and vocal styles -- ranging from whispering and singing to rapping and outright screaming -- earned Onfroy a cult following in under a year. In 2015, he released two collaborative albums, Members Only, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 -- alongside <a href=\"spotify:artist:2rhFzFmezpnW82MNqEKVry\">the Slump God</a> and various <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Members+Only%22\">Members Only</a> associates -- as well as his third and fourth EPs, ItWasn'tEnough and Willy Wonka Was a Child Murderer. \r\n\nHis debut album, Bad Vibes Forever, was originally intended to be a mixtape released in 2016; however, the expansion of the record into a full-length studio album, coupled with two separate incarcerations, repeatedly delayed the album's release. Single \"Look at Me!,\" originally released in early 2016, became a sleeper hit and was re-released in 2017, at which point it hit the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. \r\n\nWhile serving a prison sentence in 2017, Onfroy signed a deal with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Empire+Distribution%22\">Empire Distribution</a>. The label issued Revenge, an eight-song mixtape of previously released XXXTentacion material, in May of 2017. The set broke into the Top 50 of the Billboard 200 and climbed to 21 on the R&B/hip-hop chart. Onfroy's official studio debut arrived months later on <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Bad+Vibes+Forever%22\">Bad Vibes Forever</a>/<a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Empire%22\">Empire</a>. The moody 17 featured the singles \"Revenge\" and \"Jocelyn Flores,\" his tribute to a friend who committed suicide. Upon its release, 17 climbed to the number two spots on the Billboard 200 and R&B/hip-hop chart, also topping the R&B albums chart. Early the next year, his sophomore full-length, ?, was released. Debuting atop the Billboard 200, the effort featured appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2P5sC9cVZDToPxyomzF1UH\">Joey Bada$$</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4exLIFE8sISLr28sqG1qNX\">Travis Barker</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:21WS9wngs9AqFckK7yYJPM\">PnB Rock</a>, and more. Onfroy soon signed a multi-million dollar deal with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Empire+Distribution%22\">Empire Distribution</a>. Weeks later, on June 18, 2018, Onfroy was shot and killed in Miami. Following his death, the outpouring of his fans' grief helped push ? to platinum certification.\r\n\nHis first posthumous album, Skins, arrived later that year. In late 2019, Bad Vibes Forever was released. Originally conceived of as his studio debut, the album was still a work in progress at the time of his death, shelved around the time of 17. The post-mortem collection ended up being 25 tracks and nearly an hour long, and featured guest appearances from everyone from <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a> to <a href=\"spotify:artist:7jVv8c5Fj3E9VhNjxT4snq\">Lil Nas X</a>. ~ Liam Martin, Rovi",

After playing SXSW and The Great Escape, support to Paolo Nutini, Temples etc she recently just wrapped up her first EU &#43; UK headline tour.

        "biography": "&#34;Cathartic&#34;, &#34;vivacious&#34;, and &#34;ardent&#34; are examples of some words often used by followers to describe Seycara Orchestral&#39;s music. \nYuang Chen (Seycara Orchestral) is one of the most exciting up and coming voices in the world of popular orchestral music. As a classically trained composer, pianist, and trumpeter, Yuang is a graduate of the faculty of music at Queen&#39;s University in Kingston, Canada. His music is most accurately described as an easily enjoyable jambalaya of catchy pop style tunes and opulently lush orchestral score, all the while being delivered in an endearingly original style that is impossible to find elsewhere. \nDeciding to make the merging of the worlds of classical and pop music his calling, Yuang has since collaborated with artists like Gryffin and Carly Rae Jepson in creating official orchestral re-imaginations of their chart topping hits. In the concert world, Yuang&#39;s music has been performed by ensembles such as the Kingston Symphony Orchestra and the Etobicoke Philharmonic Orchestra. \nIn his &#34;day job&#34;, Yuang is a physician in Canada for both general and emergency medicine. From 2018 - 2020, Yuang was music director/composer for the University of Toronto faculty of medicine&#39;s Daffydil, an all original charitable musical production starring medical students &amp; staff with all proceeds going to the Canadian Cancer Society.",

After 10 years spent grinding and putting all her time into music, Gray found herself with an album that reflected her life as both a club kid and a storyteller in its entirety. Traversing four-to-the-floor anthems, outre interludes and cinematic orchestration, Gray describes the record as a “rollercoaster journey”, tapping into Ibiza euphoria and also the grit and unadorned glamour of clubbing in London.",

        "biography": "A boundary-breaking artist, Miley Cyrus incorporates different styles -- pop, country, hip-hop, and indie -- into her music while balancing her acting and singing careers. She established her voice with singles such as 2009's \"Party in the U.S.A.\" and furthered her reputation as a freewheeling, sometimes controversial performer with 2013's hip-hop-influenced, Grammy-nominated, triple-platinum album Bangerz. As the 2010s unfolded, Cyrus' work grew more eclectic. On the trippy pop of 2015's Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz, she collaborated with members of <a href=\"spotify:artist:16eRpMNXSQ15wuJoeqguaB\">Flaming Lips</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1l9d7B8W0IHy3LqWsxP2SH\">Phantogram</a>; on 2017's Younger Now, she paid homage to her country music heritage and worked with <a href=\"spotify:artist:32vWCbZh0xZ4o9gkz4PsEU\">Dolly Parton</a>. By the time of 2020's rock- and disco-tinged Plastic Hearts -- her sixth chart-topping album -- and 2023's Grammy-winning L.A. homage Endless Summer Vacation, Cyrus proved she could combine the different sides of her work with abandon.\r\n\nBorn Destiny Hope Cyrus in Franklin, Tennessee, her mother Tish and her father, country star <a href=\"spotify:artist:60rpJ9SgigSd16DOAG7GSa\">Billy Ray Cyrus</a>, gave her the nickname \"Smiley\" -- which they soon shortened to Miley -- because of her cheerful disposition. She caught the acting bug in 2001 after seeing a production of Mama Mia!, and made her debut with a small role on <a href=\"spotify:artist:60rpJ9SgigSd16DOAG7GSa\">Billy Ray</a>'s TV series Doc in 2003. That year, she also appeared in the Tim Burton film Big Fish. In 2005, Cyrus won the lead role in the Disney Channel TV series Hannah Montana, which chronicled the adventures of Miley Stewart, a teenage girl who moves from Nashville to Malibu and lives a secret life as a pop star; <a href=\"spotify:artist:60rpJ9SgigSd16DOAG7GSa\">Billy Ray</a> played her father and manager, Robbie Stewart. When it debuted the following March, Hannah Montana became an instant hit. The show's first soundtrack appeared in October 2006, topped the Billboard 200 Albums chart, and went on to sell over three-million copies around the world. By March 2009, the 16-year-old Cyrus was the youngest performer to have four chart-topping albums. The country-pop ballad \"The Climb,\" from that year's Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack, became Miley's first multi-platinum hit.\r\n\nCyrus' solo career was just as successful. In July 2008, her album Breakout topped the Billboard 200 Albums chart. That year, Cyrus' work in the animated film Bolt earned her a Golden Globe nomination. Her EP The Time of Our Lives appeared in August 2009 and yielded \"Party in the U.S.A.,\" a hit that charted inside the Billboard Top Ten for 16 weeks. She also found time to film another movie, an adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel The Last Song, which hit theaters in 2010. That June, she delivered the darker, dance music-influenced album Can't Be Tamed; it reached number three on the Billboard 200 Albums chart.\r\n\nFollowing the release of Can't Be Tamed, Cyrus took a hiatus from music. She made a number of television appearances that included cameos on MTV's Punk'd and CBS' Two and a Half Men, and also had roles in films such as 2012's LOL and So Undercover. By 2012, she began her return to music, releasing online videos of performances of her favorite songs. She also collaborated with producers including <a href=\"spotify:artist:4pzAvicKWenQtv9zIQim47\">Rock Mafia</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7u160I5qtBYZTQMLEIJmyz\">Borgore</a> and worked with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4RxUeUyMaEe2T5tvULq5j0\">Snoop Lion</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:085pc2PYOi8bGKj0PNjekA\">will.i.am</a> (\"Fall Down,\" her 2013 single with the <a href=\"spotify:artist:1yxSLGMDHlW21z4YXirZDS\">Black Eyed Peas</a> founder, debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 58). To make her next album, she enlisted <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell Williams</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0NWbwDZY1VkRqFafuQm6wk\">Mike WiLL Made-It</a>, and other well-known rap producers. Combining hip-hop beats with elements of synth pop, electro, and stadium rock, Bangerz debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in October 2013 and was ultimately certified triple platinum in the U.S. The album also spawned the chart-topping single \"Wrecking Ball\" and \"We Can't Stop,\" which reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. To make the break from her child-star days even clearer, Cyrus promoted Bangerz with a controversial performance at the MTV Video Music Awards. The following January, her MTV Unplugged performance -- which featured guest star <a href=\"spotify:artist:6tbjWDEIzxoDsBA1FuhfPW\">Madonna</a> -- became the show's most popular episode in a decade. In 2015, Bangerz was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 57th Grammy Awards.\r\n\nWhile touring in support of the album, Cyrus appeared on With a Little Help from My Fwends, <a href=\"spotify:artist:16eRpMNXSQ15wuJoeqguaB\">the Flaming Lips</a>' reworking of <a href=\"spotify:artist:3WrFJ7ztbogyGnTHbHJFl2\">the Beatles</a>' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and had the band join her on-stage for several tour dates. She also worked with the group's frontman, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5gfPxEps3rAgyDzS5hfxHz\">Wayne Coyne</a>, on her own music. Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz was announced and released online for free immediately after the 2015 MTV VMAs, which Cyrus hosted. In addition to <a href=\"spotify:artist:5gfPxEps3rAgyDzS5hfxHz\">Coyne</a>, the album featured Bangerz producers <a href=\"spotify:artist:0NWbwDZY1VkRqFafuQm6wk\">Mike WiLL Made-It</a> and Oren Yoel, as well as cameos by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0c173mlxpT3dSFRgMO8XPh\">Big Sean</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5H0YoDsPDi9fObFmJtTjfN\">Ariel Pink</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1l9d7B8W0IHy3LqWsxP2SH\">Phantogram</a>'s Sarah Barthel. In early 2016, Cyrus signed on to become a judge on NBC's The Voice, replacing <a href=\"spotify:artist:4yiQZ8tQPux8cPriYMWUFP\">Gwen Stefani</a>. Later that year, she co-starred in <a href=\"spotify:artist:7HPDGnxb8oSBQ0HuNx2xqR\">Woody Allen</a>'s miniseries Crisis in Six Scenes. \r\n\nAfter lending her voice to the robot alien warrior Mainframe in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2, Cyrus returned to music with September 2017's Younger Now. Co-written and produced by Cyrus and Yoel and featuring vocals by Cyrus' godmother, <a href=\"spotify:artist:32vWCbZh0xZ4o9gkz4PsEU\">Dolly Parton</a>, the album boasted a rootsier sound than her previous work and debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 Albums chart. Cyrus then appeared as a coach on the 13th season of The Voice, and in 2018 headed into the studio with producers including <a href=\"spotify:artist:4TpW7t4Cz0RG1gOEU6EcUm\">Andrew Wyatt</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3hv9jJF3adDNsBSIQDqcjp\">Mark Ronson</a>. Late that year, her first collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3hv9jJF3adDNsBSIQDqcjp\">Ronson</a>, \"Nothing Breaks Like a Heart,\" arrived and hit number 43 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart the following January. \r\n\nIn 2019, Cyrus appeared in the fifth season of the British sci-fi anthology TV series Black Mirror as pop star <a href=\"spotify:artist:14scxEoUN7Dcx1m4EQ7oHe\">Ashley O</a> in the episode \"Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too.\" \"On a Roll\" -- a clever reinterpretation of <a href=\"spotify:artist:0X380XXQSNBYuleKzav5UO\">Nine Inch Nails</a>' \"Head Like a Hole\" -- became a viral streaming hit and topped The Hollywood Reporter's TV Songs chart, making Cyrus one of a handful of singers who appeared on the charts under three separate monikers. Under her own name, Cyrus issued May 2019's She Is Coming EP, as well as June's \"Mother's Daughter,\" August's \"Slide Away,\" and September's \"Don't Call Me Angel,\" a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:66CXWjxzNUsdJxJ2JdwvnR\">Ariana Grande</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:00FQb4jTyendYWaN8pK0wa\">Lana Del Rey</a> that appeared on the Charlie's Angels soundtrack. All three singles charted on the Billboard Hot 100. In addition to her work as a performer, Cyrus also made helping others a priority by starting the Malibu Foundation to aid the community of the wildfires that devastated California's Los Angeles and Ventura counties in November 2018, and by founding the Happy Hippie Foundation, which has supported homeless and LGBTQ youth. \r\n\nCyrus launched her next album with the August 2020 release of \"Midnight Sky,\" a personal, disco-tinged single inspired by the sounds of <a href=\"spotify:artist:7FxMjqH6DH056sdsstGeVl\">Debbie Harry</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7crPfGd2k81ekOoSqQKWWz\">Stevie Nicks</a> that became a Top 20 hit in the U.S. and a Top Five hit in the U.K. (the song spawned the remix \"Edge of Midnight,\" a mash-up with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7crPfGd2k81ekOoSqQKWWz\">Nicks</a>' \"Edge of Seventeen\"). Featuring collaborations with producers including <a href=\"spotify:artist:3hv9jJF3adDNsBSIQDqcjp\">Mark Ronson</a> and singers ranging from <a href=\"spotify:artist:6M2wZ9GZgrQXHCFfjv46we\">Dua Lipa</a> to Joan Jett and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7lzordPuZEXxwt9aoVZYmG\">Billy Idol</a>, November 2020's Plastic Hearts combined '80s rock and disco influences with contemporary pop. The set debuted atop Billboard's Top Rock Albums chart, becoming her sixth number one album and making Cyrus the female artist with the most Top Ten album debuts on the U.S charts in the 21st century. \r\n\nEarly in 2021, Cyrus moved to <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Columbia+Records%22\">Columbia Records</a>; her first release for the label was that April's \"Without You,\" a remix of <a href=\"spotify:artist:2tIP7SsRs7vjIcLrU85W8J\">the Kid LAROI</a>'s single featuring Cyrus that reached number one on Billboard's Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart. That June, she collaborated with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b\">Elton John</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Dl3HXZjG6ZOWT5cV375lk\">Yo-Yo Ma</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0L8ExT028jH3ddEcZwqJJ5\">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>' <a href=\"spotify:artist:4DW34vji6G9GgGY0k2mic7\">Chad Smith</a> on a cover of <a href=\"spotify:artist:2ye2Wgw4gimLv2eAKyk1NB\">Metallica</a>'s \"Nothing Else Matters\" that appeared on the tribute album The Metallica Blacklist. Cyrus also toured North, Central, and South America extensively in 2021 and the next year, with much of April 2022's live album Attention: Miley Live capturing her February 2022 show at the Super Bowl Music Fest in Los Angeles. A few weeks later, a deluxe version of the album including performances from Cyrus' Latin American dates appeared. \r\n\nFollowing her appearance in the holiday TV specials Dolly Parton's Magic Mountain Christmas and Miley's New Year's Eve Party, Cyrus began 2023 with the January single \"Flowers,\" which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, Global 200, and Global 200 Excl. U.S. charts, and ultimately bested \"Wrecking Ball\" as her most popular single. The song was the first taste of Endless Summer Vacation, an album described as a love letter to Los Angeles and featuring production by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2sWf9Tj6EsTxURcgil3NTG\">Greg Kurstin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0raU17YI2OXuenDM7N7gfh\">Kid Harpoon</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0NWbwDZY1VkRqFafuQm6wk\">WiLL Made-It</a>, among others. Blending elements of soft rock, disco, dance-pop, country, and singer/songwriter pop, the album also included cameos from <a href=\"spotify:artist:5WUlDfRSoLAfcVSX1WnrxN\">Sia</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2sG4zTOLvjKG1PSoOyf5Ej\">Brandi Carlile</a>. Endless Summer Vacation reached number three on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart in the U.S. and topped the charts in the U.K. and eight other countries. Late in 2023, Cyrus received six Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year for Endless Summer Vacation, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the <a href=\"spotify:artist:2sG4zTOLvjKG1PSoOyf5Ej\">Carlile</a> duet \"Thousand Miles,\" and Best Pop Solo Performance, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year for \"Flowers.\" She took home her first Grammy in the Best Pop Solo category, later winning another award for Record of the Year. ~ Heather Phares, Rovi",

        "biography": "With their nervy and literate indie rock sound, Arctic Monkeys are a respected, adventurous, and successful group that could easily be called Britain's biggest band of the early 21st century. The band arrived with a blast in 2005, assisted by rave reviews and online word of mouth (they were one of the first bands to benefit from social media). They quickly became a sensation in the United Kingdom, where they were seen as the heir apparent to the throne left vacant by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2DaxqgrOhkeH0fpeiQq2f4\">Oasis</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4fSPtBgFPZzygkY6MehwQ7\">the Libertines</a>. Buoyed by the single \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor,\" their 2006 debut Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not briefly grabbed the title of fastest-selling album in British history. It landed on top of both the U.K. and U.S. rock album charts and took home the Mercury Prize. What set the group apart was <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ctkBmvz80MGyi72Ix055S\">Alex Turner</a>, a singer/songwriter with a biting wit and grasp of English vernacular (not dissimilar to <a href=\"spotify:artist:7Lf3LOZp3U3u2f6cWMd3AH\">Paul Weller</a>, the godfather of modern British rock). However, driven by their maverick creative spirit, Arctic Monkeys have proven highly unpredictable, reworking classic rock traditions on 2007's Favourite Worst Nightmare and beefing up their guitars with the assistance of <a href=\"spotify:artist:4pejUc4iciQfgdX6OKulQn\">Queens of the Stone Age</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:03xb2BUdIFzuRQ6o88yfCB\">Josh Homme</a> on 2009's Humbug. Eventually, they also laced in some of the louche lounge aspects of <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ctkBmvz80MGyi72Ix055S\">Turner</a>'s swinging side project <a href=\"spotify:artist:2Z7UcsdweVlRbAk5wH5fsf\">the Last Shadow Puppets</a>, an evolution that began on 2018's arty Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino and deepened on its 2022 follow-up The Car. By that point, the band was a staple throughout the world. \r\n\n<a href=\"spotify:artist:1ctkBmvz80MGyi72Ix055S\">Alex Turner</a> and guitarist Jamie Cook began their music careers in 2001, when the friends both received guitars for Christmas. Two years later, they began performing shows around their native Sheffield with drummer Matt Helders and bassist Andy Nicholson, two fellow students at Stocksbridge High School. A series of demo recordings followed, and Arctic Monkeys' audience swelled as fans circulated those recordings via the Internet. The musicians soon found themselves at the center of a growing media circus, with such outlets as BBC Radio examining the band's music and mounting hype.\r\n\nBy distributing their homemade material on the Internet, Arctic Monkeys were able to build a sizable fan base without the help of a record label, effectively circumventing the usual road to superstardom. They continued to buck tradition by signing with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Domino+Records%22\">Domino Records</a> in 2005, eschewing a major-label's budget for <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Domino%22\">Domino</a>'s D.I.Y. cred and hip roster (which also included <a href=\"spotify:artist:0XNa1vTidXlvJ2gHSsRi4A\">Franz Ferdinand</a>, a touchstone for the band's sound). The smart moves paid off as Arctic Monkeys' first two singles -- \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\" and \"When the Sun Goes Down\" -- both topped the U.K. charts. Critical reception was similarly favorable, but few could have predicted the whirlwind success of the band's debut album, which ousted <a href=\"spotify:artist:2DaxqgrOhkeH0fpeiQq2f4\">Oasis</a>' Definitely Maybe as the fastest-selling debut in British history (a record that was broken one year later by <a href=\"spotify:artist:5lKZWd6HiSCLfnDGrq9RAm\">Leona Lewis</a>' Spirit). Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not sold 363,735 copies during its first week alone, transforming Arctic Monkeys from underground stars into mainstream figures. \r\n\nArctic Monkeys' debut sold approximately 300,000 total copies in America -- enough to warrant more media coverage. Their success continued as they released a spring EP, Who the F**k Are Arctic Monkeys, and prepared for a stateside tour. Temporary bassist Nick O'Malley was brought aboard for the band's American shows, while a fatigued Nicholson stayed at home. Nicholson then announced his official departure when the band returned home in June 2006, and O'Malley remained with Arctic Monkeys as a permanent member. That fall, the guys received the 2006 Mercury Prize and donated the accompanying money to an undisclosed charity. Additional accolades included Best British Breakthrough Act at the BRIT Awards and Best New Band at the NME Awards. NME also made a bold assertion by deeming the group's debut one of the Top Five British albums ever released.\r\n\nReleased in April 2007, Favourite Worst Nightmare updated Arctic Monkeys' sound with louder instruments and faster tempos. The bandmates had recorded the sophomore album quickly, wishing to return to the road as soon as possible, and the speedy turnaround between records helped maintain the group's popularity at home. Favourite Worst Nightmare sold 85,000 copies during its first day of release, and all 12 tracks entered the Top 200 of the U.K. singles charts. As <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ctkBmvz80MGyi72Ix055S\">Alex Turner</a> briefly turned his attention to a side project, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2Z7UcsdweVlRbAk5wH5fsf\">the Last Shadow Puppets</a>, Arctic Monkeys received another Mercury Prize nomination and took home two titles at the 2008 BRIT Awards. Recording sessions for a third album commenced in early 2008 and lasted throughout the year, with producers James Ford (who previously worked with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ctkBmvz80MGyi72Ix055S\">Turner</a> on <a href=\"spotify:artist:2Z7UcsdweVlRbAk5wH5fsf\">the Last Shadow Puppets</a>' album) and <a href=\"spotify:artist:03xb2BUdIFzuRQ6o88yfCB\">Josh Homme</a> (frontman of <a href=\"spotify:artist:4pejUc4iciQfgdX6OKulQn\">Queens of the Stone Age</a>) adding some newfound heft to the band's sound. Meanwhile, Arctic Monkeys released a concert album entitled At the Apollo -- with accompanying video footage captured on 35mm film -- before unveiling Humbug in August 2009. Humbug went platinum in the U.K. with the singles \"Crying Lightning\" peaking at number 12 and \"Cornerstone\" topping out at 94. \r\n\nThe band hit the road that February, kicking off a multi-leg tour that ran through the rest of the year. After playing another handful of shows in early 2010, the guys took a short hiatus before reconvening with James Ford for their fourth album. Sessions began that fall, and the resulting Suck It and See arrived in spring 2011, topping the U.K. album chart and landing at number 14 on the Billboard 200. Meanwhile, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ctkBmvz80MGyi72Ix055S\">Turner</a> also wrote music for a Richard Ayoade film, Submarine, whose soundtrack doubled as the frontman's first solo release.\r\n\nIn February 2012, Arctic Monkeys released a song entitled \"R U Mine?\" on their YouTube channel, which indicated that an album was on the way. A few months later, the band played at the London Summer Olympics opening ceremony, performing \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3WrFJ7ztbogyGnTHbHJFl2\">the Beatles</a>' \"Come Together,\" but it wasn't until the summer of 2013 that the group's fifth album was to be revealed. Entitled AM, the record was released in September, a few months after a triumphant headlining performance at Glastonbury 2013, which was opened with the new song \"Do I Wanna Know?\" Both a critical and commercial success, AM topped the British charts and reached number six on the Billboard 200. It also earned the group a Mercury Prize nomination and won British Album of the Year at the BRIT Awards.\r\n\nFollowing the end of their tour in 2014, the band entered an extended hiatus, during which time the individual members pursued solo projects. In 2016, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ctkBmvz80MGyi72Ix055S\">Turner</a> released his second album with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2Z7UcsdweVlRbAk5wH5fsf\">the Last Shadow Puppets</a> and toured. Arctic Monkeys resurfaced in April 2018 with the loungey Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, a softer affair than their previous albums. Along with topping the U.K. album chart and Billboard Top Rock Albums chart, the LP became the group's fourth to earn a Mercury Prize nomination. Later that year, the band issued the TBH&C B-side \"Anyways\" as a single. A concert album, Live at the Royal Albert Hall, recorded during the Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino tour arrived in November 2020, with all proceeds going to benefit the War Child U.K. charity organization. \r\n\nArctic Monkeys began their seventh album cycle by releasing the single \"There’d Better Be a Mirrorball\" in August 2022, delivering the full-length The Car in October. Continuing the slow, stylish vibe of Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino, the album was cut in a monastery on the coast of Suffolk. It hit number six on the Billboard 200, number two in the U.K., and picked up three Grammy nominations, including for Best Alternative Music Album. ~ Andrew Leahey & Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi",

        "biography": "Wesley Tinglin moved to Kingston when he was 12 years old, quickly soaking up the rich harmonies of vocal groups like <a href=\"spotify:artist:6uSKeCyQEhvPC2NODgiqFE\">the Wailers</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6eHPmq8aR8X4TZIMvrD9Bo\">the Maytals</a>. He formed the Viceroys with Daniel Bernard and Bunny Gayle and the group earned a recording session in 1967 with producer Clement Dodd. Though \"Lose and Gain\" and \"Fat Fish\" didn't do well, the second session's \"Last Night\" and \"Ya Ho\" did much better. The year 1968 brought the band a deal with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RM3xqQNdhZknQBsyQl3ZM\">Derrick Morgan</a>, who produced several singles during the next three years (\"Rebel Nyah,\" \"Chariot Coming,\" and \"Lips and Tongue\"). During the early '70s, the Viceroys also recorded singles for Lloyd \"Matador\" Daley, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1TsG4AumsMt1Tcq2nHpov9\">Lee Perry</a>, Pete Weston, and the Demon label.\r\n\nAfter Bunny Gayle left the band, Tinglin recruited Neville Ingram as a replacement. The band subsequently recorded as both the Interns and the Viceroys. The trio finally recorded an album in the late '70s; in 1980, Norris Reid replaced Daniel Bernard. Along with a series of singles, the band recorded three albums in the early '80s, We Must Unite, Chancery Lane, and Brethren and Sistren. After a lengthy hiatus beginning in the mid-'80s, Tinglin reactivated the group with Ingram and new member Michael Gabbidon after the turn of the millennium. This edition of the Viceroys recorded Inna de Yard (live in <a href=\"spotify:artist:7qe5mAZ8x1nggNd4JiyMCj\">Earl \"Chinna\" Smith</a>'s yard in Saint Andrew Parish), released by the <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Makasound%22\">Makasound</a> label in 2006. Why followed on Luckee Rhythms in February of 2018. Stricken with lung cancer, Wesley Tinglin died in September of that year at the age of 75. ~ John Bush, Rovi",

It also gave him the opportunity to be included in the “Global Digital Artist Ranking” and continue his momentum with another hit single “Isa Lang.” In less than a month of its release, “Isa Lang” garnered over 51 million streams on Spotify and made Arthur Nery once again the spotlight in numerous top-rated Spotify playlists. \n\nArthur Nery not only captures the heart, but also captures the soul— and clearly, Arthur gained a lot of praise and support on his first ever SOLD OUT concert at the New Frontier Theater last July 2022 that just proves how people evidently admire the brilliance in his music. \n\nFor bookings and inquiries: vivamusicbookings&#64;viva.com.ph / 0998-575-3307",

        "biography": "Singer-songwriter Teddy Swims found himself on the path towards self-forgiveness when he started putting pen to paper for his debut studio album, I’ve Tried Everything But Therapy (Part 1). Though he’s released music and toured the world since making his debut in 2019, the 31-year-old Georgia-born artist has spent much of the last four years writing his way towards an album that would tell this story – his story – to the people who were ready to receive it. \n\nAn emotionally walloping and deeply resonant body of work to be released in multiple parts – much like Teddy’s own journey of self-discovery – I’ve Tried Everything But Therapy (Part 1) is an album about diving headfirst into healing without any floatation devices. It finds Teddy working out some very big, very real issues through his music. “Now I’m watching people connect with the messages and stories and realizing not only are the songs helping me, but they’re also helping them too,” he says. “It feels like all that work on the back end, all that internalizing, is finally making a difference.”\n\n&#34;My debut album is an honest look into my mental health journey. I believe therapy could really be beneficial to myself and anyone willing to take the steps to heal. But, for some reason I still have something holding me back. I know there are answers to the questions I’m not ready to ask myself. This album is my first step towards being vulnerable about this journey and the steps I need to take to heal.&#34;",

In 2022, she released her debut solo EP, IM NAYEON, followed by 2024's NA. \r\n\nBorn in Seoul in 1995, Nayeon became a <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22JYP+Entertainment%22\">JYP Entertainment</a> trainee in 2010, first joining the lineup for a short-lived group before participating in the Sixteen reality competition show to become part of <a href=\"spotify:artist:7n2Ycct7Beij7Dj7meI4X0\">Twice</a>. The nine-piece girl group debuted in 2015, swiftly rising on the Korean and U.S. charts with hit albums Twicetagram, Eyes Wide Open, and Formula of Love, while also breaking into the Japanese market with a handful of chart-topping albums and compilations. \r\n\nIn 2022, she made her formal debut as a solo artist with the self-titled EP IM NAYEON (<a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22JYP%22\">JYP</a>/Republic Records). The short set featured the tracks \"No Problem\" with Felix of <a href=\"spotify:artist:2dIgFjalVxs4ThymZ67YCE\">Stray Kids</a> and \"Love Countdown\" with Wonstein. Upon release, the effort topped the South Korean album chart and the U.S. World Albums chart. It also reached the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. \r\n\nNayeon returned in June 2024 with her sophomore EP, NA, which featured a handful of Top 40 South Korean chart hits, including \"Butterflies,\" \"Heaven\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:4BBN286rBKyCWsSPq2cxYO\">Sam Kim</a>, \"Magic\" with Julie from <a href=\"spotify:artist:0lGwv9pn5fxp2dVoocz5Ao\">Kiss of Life</a>, and \"HalliGalli.\" Also included was the single \"ABCD,\" which landed on the Global Billboard 200.

An origin, or inception, where simplicity meets intimacy. The beautiful melodies stemming from Jakob’s fingertips are left pure and uncluttered, with clever subtle nuances creating the perceived variations in dynamics and rhythm. \n\nIn 2019, his debut release “Fragment” achieved near overnight success as its four sonic chapters went on to amass over 6 million Spotify streams within one month.",

        "biography": "G-Dragon, born Kwon Ji-Yong, is a rapper from Seoul, South Korea who also writes and produces. At the age of 11, he signed to <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22YG+Entertainment%22\">YG Entertainment</a> and, a few years later, joined his label's popular group <a href=\"spotify:artist:4Kxlr1PRlDKEB0ekOCyHgX\">Big Bang</a>, for which he wrote and produced a significant amount of material. November 2008's Remember topped Korea's Gaon chart, while most of the group's releases in Japan were certified gold. In August 2009, Kwon released his first solo album, Heartbreaker; a major success, it also topped the Gaon chart. He and fellow <a href=\"spotify:artist:4Kxlr1PRlDKEB0ekOCyHgX\">Big Bang</a> member <a href=\"spotify:artist:3gWUDks2F1jPVwCiB2yCMO\">TOP</a> then collaborated on December 2010's GD & TOP, a set that was more R&B and rap-oriented than their group's dance-pop-leaning releases. Kwon then issued his first solo EP, One of a Kind, which topped the Billboard World Albums chart. The September 2012 release was led by another chart-topping single, an acoustic ballad titled \"That XX,\" as well as the hit \"Crayon.\" \r\n\nIn 2013, Kwon released his sophomore set, Coup d'Etat, which featured appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:5fMUXHkw8R8eOP2RNVYEZX\">Diplo</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:25fqWEebq6PoiGQIHIrdtv\">Baauer</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2wIVse2owClT7go1WT98tk\">Missy Elliot</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:62k5LKMhymqlDNo2DWOvvv\">Boys Noize</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7pyhre5oEEFMqcgMEvJY7q\">Sky Ferreira</a>, and Jennie Kim from <a href=\"spotify:artist:41MozSoPIsD1dJM0CLPjZF\">BlackPink</a>. Once again topping the Gaon and the Billboard World Albums charts, Coup also won World's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards. Forays into fashion and art followed, as Kwon featured on a number of high-profile collaborations, including \"Good Boy\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6udveWUgX4vu75FF0DTrXV\">Taeyang</a> (2014); \"Dirty Vibe\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5he5w2lnU9x7JFhnwcekXX\">Skrillex</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5fMUXHkw8R8eOP2RNVYEZX\">Diplo</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0tzSBCPJZmHTdOA3ZV2mN3\">CL</a> (2014); and \"Temple\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:25fqWEebq6PoiGQIHIrdtv\">Baauer</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QJIPDAEDILuo8AIq3pMuU\">M.I.A.</a> (2016). Kwon's second EP, the self-titled Kwon Ji-Yong, arrived in the summer of 2017. The five-song set -- released only as a USB -- topped the Billboard World Albums chart and Japan's Oricon digital chart, making G-Dragon the first Korean artist to do so. ~ Andy Kellman & Neil Z.

        "biography": "LOVE IS NOISE is an exercise in empathy, both lyrically and musically. The band’s Century Media debut, To live in a different way, straddles the roughshod riffing and volume of their DIY origins while embracing shoegaze-facing melodiousness, hints of Brit-pop, and a beating (and bleeding) heart erupting from Cam Humphrey’s plaintive vocals. Co-produced by the band with engineer Kel Pinchin and mixed by John Markson (Drug Church, Drain, The Story So Far), To live in a different way is a startling debut album. From the opening track, “Devotion,” where Humphrey’s voice invokes passion and positivity, to the second track, “Soft Glow,” the album’s first single where he croons, “You are the one that shines on me,” before launching into a throat-shredding exaltation of emotion amidst a crushing battery of slashing guitars and battering drums, it’s clear from the onset that LOVE IS NOISE’s heartbeat is a thunderous one. ",

As the band’s name implies, seemingly disparate passions battle within the songs, somehow beautifully making peace.  \n\nThe Austin band return after the success of their <a href=\"spotify:album:64tfW7uOt51l5TU7LyLgcf\" data-name=\"teche\">teche</a> EP, amassing 11 million-plus streams independently, inciting a flurry of activity on TikTok, and charting the top 30 of Alternative radio, the band—Alex Dugan, David Grayson, and Dillon Randolph, Caleb Contreras, and Josh Stirm —focus this fiery fusion on their upcoming debut album.",

There are very few female producers and engineers. I want to represent that you can be part of each step in the process. In the more recent years, it’s been a discovery of all the things I can do.

        "biography": "Blending atmospheric electronic textures with dark alternative rock, PVRIS evolved from a post-hardcore underground favorite to a pop-savvy international headliner within a decade. Helmed by singer/songwriter, producer, multi-instrumentalist, and LGBTQ+ icon Lyndsey Gunnulfsen, the project (pronounced \"Paris\") made its 2014 debut with White Noise, an alternative chart hit in the U.S. and U.K. Three years later, PVRIS returned with the pulsing sophomore effort All We Know of Heaven, All We Need of Hell. At the turn of the decade, the band's sound had matured into an urgent, melodic hybrid of beat-driven synth rock, which could be heard on their third set, Use Me. At this time, Gunnulfsen revealed that she had been the main architect behind PVRIS all along, handling songwriting, production, and instrumentation from the start. She returned in 2023 with the empowering fourth LP Evergreen.\r\n\nFormed in 2012 in Lowell, Massachusetts, the group's earliest incarnation was as a local metalcore outfit before vocalist Gunnulfsen branched off to start PVRIS with the help of bassist Brian MacDonald, drummer Brad Griffin, and guitarist Alex Babinski. At this initial stage, the project echoed contemporaries such as <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pjCYG6hPLBO3y4swxu3dh\">Tonight Alive</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6yhD1KjhLxIETFF7vIRf8B\">Against the Current</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:74XFHRwlV6OrjEM0A2NCMF\">Paramore</a>, a sound heard on the self-titled debut EP released in early 2013. Meanwhile, Gunn and her bandmates built a devoted following as a live act with summer dates on the Vans Warped Tour and the Rise Up Tour with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2HSp2S2KwxKE7sASl6bMR9\">Skylit Drive</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Z88iXWc4YVhtu1eFtsGk6\">Wolves at the Gate</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5dLBN2tOGTJwWb5oj3QQ9v\">For All Those Sleeping</a>. In late 2013, Griffin parted ways with the group, leaving a core trio led by Gunn. Teaming up with producer Blake Harnage (<a href=\"spotify:artist:4eKPRVGa84xWm2baiQUiu9\">Versa</a>), they entered the studio to work on their first official album.\r\n\nIn June 2014, PVRIS announced that they had signed with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Rise+Records%22\">Rise Records</a>, becoming the first female-fronted act on the famed metalcore label's roster. Their debut LP, White Noise, arrived in November of that year. Peaking within the Top Ten on the U.S. Alternative chart, the album was also a hit in the U.K. After a year of consistent touring, PVRIS announced their first headlining trek, which coincided with the re-release of White Noise, featuring the previously unreleased single \"You and I.\" In 2017, they joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:12Chz98pHFMPJEknJQMWvI\">Muse</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0RqtSIYZmd4fiBKVFqyIqD\">Thirty Seconds to Mars</a> on the road, just before the release of their sophomore set, All We Know of Heaven, All We Need of Hell. The album featured the singles \"Heaven\" and \"What's Wrong.\" A remix by <a href=\"spotify:artist:1xHQO9GJIW9OXHxGBISYc5\">Marian Hill</a> of the album track \"Same Soul\" appeared in 2018 featuring singer <a href=\"spotify:artist:6QrQ7OrISRYIfS5mtacaw2\">Jaymes Young</a>.\r\n\nIn 2019, Gunnulfsen returned with a new label (<a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Warner%22\">Warner</a>) and a new sound heard on the single \"Death of Me,\" a pulsing synth-washed dance tune co-written with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1UfzhwcOR4yfX7yHTPfC9m\">Joywave</a>'s Daniel Armbruster. Another electronic-influenced track, the <a href=\"spotify:artist:64KEffDW9EtZ1y2vBYgq8T\">Marshmello</a>-assisted \"Hallucinations,\" followed a month later. Both songs were included on the five-track Hallucinations, a stopgap EP issued to sate fans before the next release cycle. While awaiting that album, Gunnulfsen shared the singles \"Dead Weight\" and \"Gimme a Minute,\" which pushed the project even further into electronic territory. After months of waiting and delays, the cathartic Use Me finally arrived that August. Collaborating with JT Daly (<a href=\"spotify:artist:0pCNk4D3E2xtszsm6hMsWr\">K.Flay</a>), Gunnulfsen dove deep for the LP, touching upon everything from relationship woes to her struggles with autoimmune disease. The week of the album's release, it was announced that Babinski had parted ways with the project. \r\n\nOver the next few years, Gunnulfsen collaborated with the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:034u8Qcs47NHkRQXaWkLXW\">morgxn</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0THdxk7bYWo6wciF1gInBK\">Kat Cunning</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1UfzhwcOR4yfX7yHTPfC9m\">Joywave</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4aKdmOXdUKX07HVd3sGgzw\">Rezz</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7DBibsUWd2RMKmXbple4xZ\">HOKO</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4OkceeWNJehKqXINqtVeX1\">TWIN XL</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7sBtBCNVRujQhaHDODkfTN\">Miyavi</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0YhUSm86okLWldQVwJkLlP\">Bad Suns</a>, and more. She also released the stand-alone PVRIS single \"Monster.\" In 2022, she issued the tracks \"Anywhere But Here\" and \"Animal,\" which were accompanied by a short film directed by friend and tourmate Jax Anderson. In addition to 2023's rousing anthem \"Goddess,\" they were the first tastes of the next PVRIS era, which arrived that July in the form of Evergreen. Centered on themes of empowerment, the album further refined the project's melodic, alt-rock hybrid sound, as heard on songs such as the <a href=\"spotify:artist:6xBZgSMsnKVmaAxzWEwMSD\">Mike Shinoda</a>-assisted \"Take My Nirvana.\" ~ Neil Z.

        "biography": "Idiosyncratic pop singer Ed Sheeran borrows from any style that crosses his path, molding genres to fit a musical character all his own that's charming, personable, and popular on a global scale. Elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock can be heard in his big hits \"The A Team,\" \"Sing,\" \"Thinking Out Loud,\" and \"Shape of You\" -- which gives him a broad appeal among different demographics. It also helped elevate him to international acclaim not long after the release of his 2011 debut LP, +, and took 2014's x and 2017's ÷ to the top of both the U.K. albums chart and the Billboard 200. Sheeran maintained his stardom with savvy collaborations -- his 2019 album No. 6 Collaborations Project featured an eclectic roster including <a href=\"spotify:artist:6LuN9FCkKOj5PcnpouEgny\">Khalid</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4nDoRrQiYLoBzwC5BhVJzF\">Camila Cabello</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4kYSro6naA4h99UJvo89HB\">Cardi B</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1uNFoZAHBGtllmzznpCI3s\">Justin Bieber</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4YLtscXsxbVgi031ovDDdh\">Chris Stapleton</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0du5cEVh5yTK9QJze8zA0C\">Bruno Mars</a> -- and by continuing to write candidly about his life: his 2021 album = was filled with songs about being a new father. Sheeran's musical explorations continued on -, a 2023 album that featured several tracks co-written and co-produced by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hSyEBc9TBb9j38FOCdkIf\">Aaron Dessner</a> of <a href=\"spotify:artist:2cCUtGK9sDU2EoElnk0GNB\">the National</a>, and its swiftly released companion, Autumn Variations, both of which reached the Top Five in the U.K. and on the Billboard 200.\r\n\nWhen Ed Sheeran released +, he had just turned 20. He had been playing music since he was a child in Framlingham, Suffolk -- he was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire but his family moved when he was young -- enthralled by the classic rock he heard around the house. Sheeran started writing music in his early teens, recording a self-made album called Spinning Man when he was 13 in 2004. In addition to making music at home -- he put out an EP titled The Orange Room in 2005 -- he'd busk on the streets and play whatever stage he could find. When he was 16, he dropped out of school and moved to London so he could make a go of a professional career, landing work as a guitar tech for Nizlopi, gigging whenever he could, and auditioning unsuccessfully for the ITV series Britannia High. The self-released EP You Need Me arrived in 2009 -- it followed 2006's eponymous EP and 2007's Want Some? -- but his momentum started to build in 2010 thanks to the EPs Loose Change and Songs I Wrote with Amy and, especially, performance videos he posted to YouTube. Sheeran started to generate considerable buzz -- <a href=\"spotify:artist:7LnaAXbDVIL75IVPnndf7w\">Jamie Foxx</a> invited him to appear on his Sirius/XM radio show -- and he landed a deal with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Asylum+Records%22\">Asylum Records</a> in late 2010. After a final independent EP, No. 5 Collaborations, arrived in January 2011, he signed a contract with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b\">Elton John</a>'s management team.\r\n\nAll of this laid the groundwork for a busy 2011. Sheeran entered the studio with <a href=\"spotify:artist:20twLKFb2Nhd8duUH0k2DJ\">Jake Gosling</a> to record his major-label debut. Its first single, \"The A Team,\" arrived in June 2011, entering the charts at number three. August brought \"You Need Me, I Don't Need You,\" setting the stage for the September release of +. Assisted by the success of November's single \"Lego House,\" the record became a huge hit in the U.K., a fact underscored by his win of British Breakthrough in the 2012 Brit Awards. Sheeran's success soon spread to Australia, Europe, Canada, and then the United States. He received a boost in the U.S. by opening for <a href=\"spotify:artist:3rIZMv9rysU7JkLzEaC5Jp\">Snow Patrol</a> in 2012, but that paled in comparison to the exposure he received opening for <a href=\"spotify:artist:06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\">Taylor Swift</a> on her Red tour in 2013. His endorsement from <a href=\"spotify:artist:06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\">Swift</a>, combined with his landing of the closing credits song \"I See Fire\" for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, set Sheeran up for an eventful 2014.\r\n\nAlong with reuniting with <a href=\"spotify:artist:20twLKFb2Nhd8duUH0k2DJ\">Jake Gosling</a>, Sheeran worked with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1EpmQFTiJbcxzwbLpuUL8L\">Rick Rubin</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell</a> for X, the sophomore set that arrived in June 2014. X debuted at number one on both sides of the Atlantic and generated the huge hits \"Thinking Out Loud\" and \"Sing,\" success that helped Sheeran secure a win for Album of the Year in the 2015 Brit Awards, along with the trophy for Best Male Solo Artist. His success wasn't limited to Britain. X was the second biggest-selling album in the world in 2015, coming in behind <a href=\"spotify:artist:4dpARuHxo51G3z768sgnrY\">Adele</a>'s 25, and \"Thinking Out Loud\" took home the Grammys for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance in 2016.\r\n\nSheeran spent the majority of 2016 recuperating and recording his third album with executive producer <a href=\"spotify:artist:5CiGnKThu5ctn9pBxv7DGa\">Benny Blanco</a>. Early in 2017, he released two singles, \"Castle on the Hill\" and \"Shape of You,\" with the latter reaching number one on the charts throughout the world. Their parent album, ÷, appeared in March. ÷ topped the pop charts in over 20 territories, including the U.K. and U.S., and it generated another international hit in \"Galway Girl.\" Ed Sheeran's massive popularity was confirmed in June 2017, when he was awarded an MBE on the occasion of the Queen's Birthday Honours. Over the next year, Sheeran stayed busy touring. He also picked up several more accolades including winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album for ÷ and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Shape of You.\" \r\n\nIn 2019, he paired with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1uNFoZAHBGtllmzznpCI3s\">Justin Bieber</a> for the single \"I Don't Care.\" It was the first of a series of duets which Sheeran collected on No. 6 Collaborations Project. The album appeared on July 12, 2019 and topped numerous charts just a few weeks after the release of Yesterday, a Danny Boyle film set in an alternate world where <a href=\"spotify:artist:3WrFJ7ztbogyGnTHbHJFl2\">the Beatles</a> never existed that featured Sheeran in a pivotal role. No. 6 Collaborations Project went on to be nominated for a Grammy in the Best Pop Vocal Album category. In December 2020, Sheeran offered up the acoustic non-album single, \"Afterglow\" as a Christmas gift to his fans. \r\n\nSheeran returned with \"Bad Habits\" in June 2021; the single topped the charts in nearly every country, save the U.S., where it peaked at two. The track was the first single from his fifth album, =. Arriving in October 2021, the record found Sheeran grappling with fatherhood and featured songwriting collaborations from <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bUqnkrDrb4f7rqmDR9yDu\">Foy Vance</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7bhMBjjQhgPX0q9S4Ajncn\">Ben Kweller</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:32opPqLCT3sF24Aso7wTXw\">Natalie Hemby</a>, among others. It continued Sheeran's streak of number one albums in the U.K. and was equally successful internationally. That December, he joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b\">Elton John</a> for the holiday song \"Merry Christmas,\" which topped the U.K. singles chart and Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. The single was also included on a Christmas edition of =, as well as <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b\">John</a>'s The Lockdown Sessions. Sheeran then collaborated with Colombian singer <a href=\"spotify:artist:1vyhD5VmyZ7KMfW5gqLgo5\">J Balvin</a> on 2021's \"Sigue\" and 2022's \"Forever My Love.\" Also in 2022, he scored a Top Ten U.K. hit with the Pokémon-related \"Celestial\" before kicking off 2023 with \"F64,\" a heartfelt tribute to the late British music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards. \r\n\nSheeran launched the cycle for his fifth album in early 2023 with the release of the singles \"Eyes Closed\" and \"Boat.\" Both songs were included on -, a record that featured several collaborations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hSyEBc9TBb9j38FOCdkIf\">Aaron Dessner</a> of <a href=\"spotify:artist:2cCUtGK9sDU2EoElnk0GNB\">the National</a>, along with work by <a href=\"spotify:artist:1rjeVTt9Ra1ldvN7SpeK0G\">Max Martin</a>, Shellback, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bUqnkrDrb4f7rqmDR9yDu\">Foy Vance</a>. Four months afterward - debuted at number one in the U.K. and number two in the U.S. Sheeran released Autumn Variations, an album recorded with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hSyEBc9TBb9j38FOCdkIf\">Dessner</a> as producer. The latter album also topped the charts in the U.K. and reached the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. By the end of the year, - had earned a Best Pop Vocal Album nomination at the 66th Grammy Awards. The singer's first-ever greatest-hits album, +-=÷× TOUR COLLECTION, arrived in September 2024 and combined live recordings  with some of his most beloved studio hits. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi",

        "biography": "Among the most popular and acclaimed artists in postmillennial contemporary music, Rihanna is also uncommonly dynamic, having mixed and matched pure pop, dancehall, R&B, EDM, and adult contemporary material throughout her career. She went supernova in 2005 with her boisterous debut single, \"Pon de Replay,\" a worldwide hit, and was a near-constant presence in the upper reaches of global pop charts until she took a break from releasing music in the late 2010s. Through 2017, the native Barbadian headlined 11 number one hits, including \"Umbrella\" and \"Only Girl (In the World),\" singles that earned her two of her nine Grammy Awards. More than just a singles artist, Rihanna continually pushed ahead stylistically with her LPs, highlighted by the bold Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), the steely Rated R (2009), and the composed Anti (2016), all of which confounded expectations and placed within the Top Ten of the Billboard 200 with eventual multi-platinum certifications. Rihanna studded her secondary discography as a featured artist during this period with major crossover pop hits headlined by the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a> (\"Run This Town\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR\">Eminem</a> (\"Love the Way You Lie\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a> (\"LOYALTY.\"). She returned to the Top Ten in 2022 with the understated ballad \"Lift Me Up,\" her first solo release in six years, recorded for the soundtrack of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\r\n\nBorn Robyn Rihanna Fenty in Saint Michael, Barbados, Rihanna exhibited star quality as a child, often winning beauty and talent contests. Because she lived on a fairly remote island in the West Indies, however, she didn't foresee the global stardom she later attained. Her break came courtesy of a fateful meeting with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0kbIz7wAczMyXXs9tfdDNE\">Evan Rogers</a>, writer and producer of pop hits for such big names as <a href=\"spotify:artist:6Ff53KvcvAj5U7Z1vojB5o\">*NSYNC</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1l7ZsJRRS8wlW3WfJfPfNS\">Christina Aguilera</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2tFN9ubMXEhdAQvdQxcsma\">Jessica Simpson</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2y8Jo9CKhJvtfeKOsYzRdT\">Rod Stewart</a>. The New Yorker was vacationing in Barbados with his wife, an island native, when he was introduced to an aspiring singing group that featured Rihanna. The trio performed for <a href=\"spotify:artist:0kbIz7wAczMyXXs9tfdDNE\">Rogers</a>, who was then eager to work with Rihanna as a solo artist. After the fledgling singer recorded material with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0kbIz7wAczMyXXs9tfdDNE\">Rogers</a> in the U.S. and signed with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22SRP%22\">SRP</a> (Syndicated Rhythm Productions), operated by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0kbIz7wAczMyXXs9tfdDNE\">Rogers</a> and partner Carl Sturken, she sparked the interest of the Carter Administration -- that is, the newly appointed <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Def+Jam%22\">Def Jam</a> president <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter</a>. Following an audition, Rihanna accepted an on-the-spot offer to sign with the major label. \r\n\nCome May 2005, <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Def+Jam%22\">Def Jam</a> rolled out \"Pon de Replay,\" Rihanna's first single and the lively introduction to the full-length Music of the Sun. Produced almost entirely by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0kbIz7wAczMyXXs9tfdDNE\">Rogers</a> and Sturken, the song synthesized Caribbean rhythms with pop-R&B songwriting. \"Pon de Replay\" caught fire almost immediately and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, denied the top spot by <a href=\"spotify:artist:4iHNK0tOyZPYnBU7nGAgpQ\">Mariah Carey</a>'s \"We Belong Together.\" Music of the Sun, released that August, spawned a Top 40 placement with \"If It's Lovin' That You Want\" and ranged stylistically from a remake of <a href=\"spotify:artist:6mLXvSt7Xxy2r9uBba1O6Z\">Dawn Penn</a>'s rocksteady-styled crossover hit \"You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)\" (featuring dancehall star <a href=\"spotify:artist:2NUz5P42WqkxilbI8ocN76\">Vybz Kartel</a>) to the <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m\">Beyoncé</a>-like \"Let Me\" (co-produced by emergent duo <a href=\"spotify:artist:7KUri7klyLaIFXLcuuOMCd\">Stargate</a>). Music of the Sun was only eight months old when Rihanna followed up in April 2006 with A Girl Like Me. It showed that the singer wasn't a fluke success and could also stretch out, laced with three dissimilar hits. \"SOS,\" high-gloss dance-pop with a sample of <a href=\"spotify:artist:6aq8T2RcspxVOGgMrTzjWc\">Soft Cell</a>'s version of \"Tainted Love,\" topped the Hot 100. \"Unfaithful,\" her first big ballad, and \"Break It Off,\" an electro-dancehall hybrid (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Isy6kedDrgPYoTS1dazA9\">Sean Paul</a>), became her third and fourth Top Ten pop singles.\r\n\nSuperstar status was attained with Good Girl Gone Bad, an album that built on Rihanna's commercial momentum and developed into a blockbuster. Released in May 2007 and \"reloaded\" with additional material the following June, its lengthy promotional campaign yielded several chart-topping singles and boasted collaborations with A-listers such as <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:21E3waRsmPlU7jZsS13rcj\">Ne-Yo</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Y5TRrQiqgUO4S36tzjIRZ\">Timbaland</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Justin Timberlake</a>. Lead single \"Umbrella,\" co-written by <a href=\"spotify:artist:1W3FSF1BLpY3hlVIgvenLz\">the-Dream</a> and Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, sounded like nothing else on the airwaves and shot to number one, as did \"Take a Bow\" and \"Disturbia,\" while \"Hate That I Love You\" and \"Don't Stop the Music\" added to the tally of Top Ten entries. \"Umbrella\" gave Rihanna her first Grammy win for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. The album was on its way to triple-platinum status by October 2009, when Rihanna set the dark and provocative tone for fourth album Rated R with \"Russian Roulette,\" another <a href=\"spotify:artist:21E3waRsmPlU7jZsS13rcj\">Ne-Yo</a> collaboration and Top Ten single. Abused lover, dominatrix, and murderer were among the perspectives Rihanna offered throughout the album, released that November. Even the additional Top Ten hits \"Hard\" and \"Rude Boy\" -- the latter her fifth number one -- were stern in demeanor, making the early hits sound like the work of a significantly more complex artist. While Rated R was riding high, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>'s \"Run This Town,\" with Rihanna on the intro and hook, won Grammys for Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.\r\n\nAnnual studio albums, each one with a November release date and a broad range of light and dark material covering EDM, contemporary R&B, adult contemporary, dancehall, and straight-up pop, continued well into the following decade. In 2010, just after <a href=\"spotify:artist:7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR\">Eminem</a> featured her on the diamond platinum \"Love the Way You Lie,\" there was Loud. Led by the <a href=\"spotify:artist:7KUri7klyLaIFXLcuuOMCd\">Stargate</a>-produced \"Only Girl (In the World),\" eventually a Grammy winner for Best Dance Recording, it was sustained with additional Hot 100 toppers \"What's My Name?\" (featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>) and \"S&M.\" Talk That Talk was heralded in 2011 with Rihanna's most triumphant single, \"We Found Love,\" on which she collaborated with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7CajNmpbOovFoOoasH2HaY\">Calvin Harris</a>. After she nabbed yet another Best Rap/Sung Collaboration Grammy, this time for her role on <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>'s \"All of the Lights,\" the streak concluded, and culminated, with the 2012 set Unapologetic. Her first LP to top the Billboard 200 (after all of the previous six had gone Top Ten), it also became her first to win a Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album. \"Diamonds,\" the anthemic and inspirational standout among some of Rihanna's brashest moments, became her tenth number one pop hit and 18th to peak within the Top Ten.\r\n\nWithin a span of three years, Rihanna had released her fourth through seventh albums. An equal amount of time passed prior to the release of her eighth full-length. In 2013, she lengthened her list of chart accolades as a featured artist with an assist on <a href=\"spotify:artist:7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR\">Eminem</a>'s \"The Monster,\" which became her 25th Top Ten hit as a lead or featured artist, went to number one, and led to her fourth Best Rap/Sung Collaboration Grammy. No longer with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Def+Jam%22\">Def Jam</a> -- a deal had been signed with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Roc+Nation%22\">Roc Nation</a> via <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, who left <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Def+Jam%22\">Def Jam</a> several years earlier -- Rihanna released non-album singles throughout 2015, beginning with the unembellished \"FourFiveSeconds,\" an unlikely matchup with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4STHEaNw4mPZ2tzheohgXB\">Paul McCartney</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a> that reached number four. \"American Oxygen\" didn't flourish as much from a commercial standpoint but upon release became one of her most remarkable recordings, a dignified ballad with a personal, pro-immigration theme.\r\n\nAlbum eight, the strikingly composed Anti, became Rihanna's second consecutive number one album following its January 2016 arrival. She partnered again with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>, resulting in another number one hit with \"Work.\" \"Needed Me,\" a buzzing slow jam cooked up with a production team including <a href=\"spotify:artist:0YinUQ50QDB7ZxSCLyQ40k\">DJ Mustard</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6cKkRS7JwVT2K3rCCnOHyk\">Kuk Harrell</a>, and \"Love on the Brain,\" a throwback soul belter involving <a href=\"spotify:artist:6cKkRS7JwVT2K3rCCnOHyk\">Harrell</a> and Fred Ball, entered the Top Ten as well. Those who missed the comparative lack of high-spirited exuberance in Anti were placated across 2016 and 2017 with Rihanna's guest appearances on <a href=\"spotify:artist:7CajNmpbOovFoOoasH2HaY\">Calvin Harris</a>' \"This Is What You Came For\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5wPoxI5si3eJsYYwyXV4Wi\">N.E.R.D.</a>'s \"Lemon.\" Meanwhile, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QHgL1lAIqAw0HtD7YldmP\">DJ Khaled</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a> likewise profited from Rihanna's featured spots. <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a>'s \"LOYALTY.\" made Rihanna a five-time winner of the Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, setting a record for women artists in that category.\r\n\nApart from a featured appearance on <a href=\"spotify:artist:2HPaUgqeutzr3jx5a9WyDV\">PartyNextDoor</a>'s 2020 single \"Believe It,\" Rihanna wasn't behind any new music for several years, as she focused her efforts on her Fenty cosmetics and fashion empire and started a family. She returned in October 2022 with \"Lift Me Up\" from the soundtrack of Ryan Coogler's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. The ballad, written by Rihanna with producer <a href=\"spotify:artist:24eDfi2MSYo3A87hCcgpIL\">Ludwig Göransson</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:687cZJR45JO7jhk1LHIbgq\">Tems</a>, and Coogler, entered the Hot 100 at number two. ~ Andy Kellman & Jason Birchmeier, Rovi",

        "biography": "When 11-time 2023 Billboard Music Awards-winner &amp; Top Male Artist Morgan Wallen released his third studio album One Thing At A Time in 2023, its instant success left The New York Times proclaiming Wallen as “one of the biggest stars in pop, period.” One Thing At A Time has remained atop the all-genre Billboard 200 chart for 19 non-consecutive weeks and was the most-streamed album of the year on Spotify. The album’s 6x-Platinum single “Last Night” reeled in over 1.5 billion streams globally, becoming the most-streamed song of any genre in the U.S. across Apple Music and Spotify, and the longest running No. 1 solo song in Hot 100 history (16 weeks total). Recent collab with Post Malone, “I Had Some Help,” debuted at country radio with 167 first week adds, becoming only the second single in chart history to debut with the support of all reporting stations. With 13 chart-toppers at country radio, Wallen played for 5 countries/3 continents in 2023 for his One Night At A Time World Tour stadium tour. Performing to over 2.4 million fans, One Night At A Time was named a Pollstar &amp; Billboard Country Tour of the Year, surpassing attendance records in numerous stops; including Ohio Stadium, where Wallen became the largest weekend ever for the venue. The 36-show 2024 extension of One Night At A Time takes Wallen to 24 additional stadium-plays, and will include Wallen’s first European run. Wallen donates a portion from every ticket sold to his Morgan Wallen Foundation.",

        "biography": "Diamond-certified American hitmaker Post Malone bridges the gap between the worlds of rap and the pop mainstream. Within five years of his debut, he went from underground genre novelty to certified superstar, amassing a string of Top Ten singles with a hybrid style that combined his unique vocal delivery, pained lyrics, and hip-hop production inspired as much by Tim McGraw as Kanye West. After the release of his 2015 quintuple-platinum single &#34;White Iverson,&#34; off his debut, Stoney, he quickly ascended to the top of the pop mainstream in the late 2010s with a succession of multi-platinum hits that included chart-toppers &#34;Rockstar&#34; with 21 Savage and &#34;Psycho&#34; with Ty Dolla $ign from 2018&#39;s Grammy-nominated Beerbongs &amp; Bentleys and one of the highest-certified singles in RIAA history, &#34;Sunflower&#34; with Swae Lee, from 2019&#39;s pop-leaning Hollywood&#39;s Bleeding. After dialing things back with 2022&#39;s vulnerable Twelve Carat Toothache, he made a further push into guitar-based pop with 2023&#39;s Austin.",

        "biography": "One of the biggest British pop artists to emerge in the 2000s, Sophie Ellis-Bextor soared to the top of the U.K. charts with her glossy, disco- and '80s-synth-pop influenced dance sound. Initially gaining buzz as the lead singer of the jangly Brit-pop band <a href=\"spotify:artist:2KH02FBsMyI9CwOtZEaLpV\">theaudience</a>, Ellis-Bextor established herself as a pop diva with her chart-topping anthem \"Murder on the Dancefloor,\" which helped take her 2001 debut, Read My Lips, to number two on the U.K. Albums Chart. She remained a chart favorite in the U.K. and Europe, hitting the top 20 with 2003's Shoot from the Hip and 2011's Trip the Light Fantastic, before rounding out her dance-pop period with 2011's Make a Scene; the first on her own EGBG label. While dance music remains a core aspect of her work, she has expanded her sound, collaborating on a series of folk and orchestral pop productions with acclaimed singer, songwriter, and producer <a href=\"spotify:artist:5EOPLr73C9nIPYwVEAsiOY\">Ed Harcourt</a>, including 2014's Wanderlust, 2016's Familia, and 2023's Hana. \r\n\nBorn in 1979 in London, Ellis-Bextor grew up in a creative household, the daughter of BBC presenter Janet Ellis and producer/director Robin Bextor. Along with her early appearances alongside her mother on the children's show Blue Peter, Ellis-Bextor became interested in performing and sang with the W11 Opera children's opera in her teens. By age 17, she had joined the Brit-pop outfit <a href=\"spotify:artist:2KH02FBsMyI9CwOtZEaLpV\">theaudience</a>, appearing on the group's eponymously titled debut. Released in 1996, theaudience reached number 22 on the U.K. Albums Chart and spawned several singles, including \"I've Got the Wherewithal\" and the Top 30 track \"A Pessimist Is Never Disappointed.\" A sophomore album never materialized and by 1999 <a href=\"spotify:artist:2KH02FBsMyI9CwOtZEaLpV\">theaudience</a> had broken up. \r\n\nAfter the group split up, Ellis-Bextor embarked on a solo career, emerging as a major star alongside Italian DJ/producer <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bmymFwDu9zLCiTRUmrewb\">Spiller</a> on the single \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love).\" Though already popular in the clubs as an instrumental, the track picked up steam after <a href=\"spotify:artist:4bmymFwDu9zLCiTRUmrewb\">Spiller</a> added Ellis-Bextor's vocals in August of 2000, eventually topping the singles charts in the U.K. and several other countries. A year later, she again topped the U.K. singles chart with \"Take Me Home,\" before serving up another chart-topper in the ultra-cool disco anthem \"Murder on the Dancefloor.\" Produced and co-written with the <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Grjlu7ncIuCaSYvCs9fcd\">New Radicals</a> frontman <a href=\"spotify:artist:2sEKfBxQGL428O3RMhol13\">Gregg Alexander</a>, the song was a smash throughout Europe. All of these singles anchored Ellis-Bextor's 2001 solo debut, Read My Lips. Showcasing a blend of '80s-influenced synth-pop and disco, the album proved a significant hit in the U.K. where it reached number two. It also performed well in Europe, hitting the Top 20 in several countries. \r\n\nIn 2003, the singer delivered her sophomore effort, Shoot from the Hip, another dance-oriented album which again featured production and co-writing by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2sEKfBxQGL428O3RMhol13\">Alexander</a>, as well as Matt Rowe, Jeremy Wheatley, and Damian LeGassick. The album spawned two Top Ten singles in \"Mixed Up World\" and \"I Won’t Change You.\" It also included the song \"I Am Not Good at Not Getting What I Want,\" co-penned by Ellis-Bextor and founding-<a href=\"spotify:artist:6PHIK3kjWggLtVygsOtpqS\">Suede</a> guitarist <a href=\"spotify:artist:28pqwEjm2WDueRWP4AjA1x\">Bernard Butler</a>. As the album was gaining traction, peaking at number 19 on the U.K. Albums Chart, Ellis-Bextor took some time off to give birth to her first child. \r\n\nShe returned in 2007 with her third album, Trip the Light Fantastic. Showcasing a sleek, electronic dance-pop and disco aesthetic, it found her working with a handful of name producers, including <a href=\"spotify:artist:2sWf9Tj6EsTxURcgil3NTG\">Greg Kurstin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:73j1Dkuu6FdSiuT0epNpuy\">Xenomania</a>, and Dimitri Tikovoi, among others. Heralded by the Top Ten hit \"Catch You,\" the album reached number seven in the U.K. and spawned several more singles in \"Me and My Imagination\" and \"Today the Sun's on Us.\" The deluxe edition of the album also featured the tracks \"Can't Have It All,\" co-written with Eg White and \"Supersonic,\" featuring backing vocals by <a href=\"spotify:artist:3gdbcIdNypBsYNu3iiCjtN\">the B-52s</a>' <a href=\"spotify:artist:7HWVWTbgJBXqBX6Jd4AvzJ\">Fred Schneider</a>.\r\n\nOn the heels of the album's release, Ellis-Bextor joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:19ra5tSw0tWufvUp8GotLo\">George Michael</a> on tour, before also joining <a href=\"spotify:artist:1XgFuvRd7r5g0h844A5ZUQ\">Take That</a> on their tour. Several collaborative singles followed, including appearing on <a href=\"spotify:artist:49H2dQUNhIlso7VNkS8nFR\">the Freemason</a>'s \"Heartbreak (Make Me a Dancer)\" in 2009 and Junior Calderone's \"Can't Fight This Feeling\" in 2010. Both tracks eventually paved the way for and were included on her fourth album. Released in the summer of 2011, Make a Scene was her most dance-oriented album yet, again featuring production by a bevy of producers, including the returning <a href=\"spotify:artist:2sWf9Tj6EsTxURcgil3NTG\">Kurstin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7CajNmpbOovFoOoasH2HaY\">Calvin Harris</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1U3sbewNFRq4oyhUWZinMi\">Richard X</a>, Hannah Robinson, <a href=\"spotify:artist:54QMjE4toDfiCryzYWCpXX\">Metronomy</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1EJWNhiYbOyeUHbsS7Kp1P\">the Sneaker Pimps</a>' Liam Howe, and others. It reached 33 on the U.K. Albums Chart and marked her first album released under her own <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Universal%22\">Universal</a> imprint EGBG.\r\n\nBy 2012, she was back in the studio to work with British indie hero <a href=\"spotify:artist:5EOPLr73C9nIPYwVEAsiOY\">Ed Harcourt</a>, who had already collaborated with her on the song \"Cut Straight to the Heart\" off Make a Scene. <a href=\"spotify:artist:5EOPLr73C9nIPYwVEAsiOY\">Harcourt</a> ended up co-writing and producing what would become Wanderlust, which appeared in January 2014. Released on the heels of Ellis-Bextor's appearance on BBC TV's Strictly Come Dancing, the album debuted at four on the U.K. charts on its way to silver certification; it was her biggest hit since 2003's Shoot from the Hip. With <a href=\"spotify:artist:5EOPLr73C9nIPYwVEAsiOY\">Harcourt</a>'s creative input, the album found Ellis-Bextor moving away from the electronic dance-pop of her previous work and embracing blend of folk and orchestral-tinged indie-pop.\r\n\nShe returned in 2016 with Familia, an album that reunited her with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5EOPLr73C9nIPYwVEAsiOY\">Harcourt</a> and featured a blend of folk and pop with some Latin American and disco-influences. Buoyed by the singles \"Come with Us,\" \"Crystallise,\" \"Wild Forever,\" and \"Death of Love,\" the album hit 12 on the U.K. Albums Chart.\r\n\nAnother collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5EOPLr73C9nIPYwVEAsiOY\">Harcourt</a>, The Song Diaries, appeared in 2018 and featured reworked renditions of some of the singer's past releases, including orchestral versions of the tracks \"Take Me Home\" and \"Murder on the Dancefloor.\" 2020 saw Ellis-Bextor issue the greatest-hits collection Songs from the Kitchen Disco, which included a newly recorded cover version of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5HnkAAaf0MCIxMWzsJNrdg\">Alcazar</a>'s \"Crying at the Discoteque.\" \r\n\nThe singer's fourth <a href=\"spotify:artist:5EOPLr73C9nIPYwVEAsiOY\">Harcourt</a>-helmed album, Hana, arrived in June 2023. Inspired by a trip to Tokyo and named after the Japanese word for \"blossom,\" the album featured a more organic, synth- and prog-rock-style sound. A Top 10 hit on the U.K. and Scotland charts, the album included the singles \"Breaking the Circle,\" \"Lost in the Sunshine,\" and \"Everything Is Sweet.\" That year, she also collaborated with composer <a href=\"spotify:artist:6xpxzGS2J2tijVVWp2RY0j\">David Arnold</a> on Mog's Christmas with the song \"As Long As I Belong\" and joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:2HcwFjNelS49kFbfvMxQYw\">Robbie Williams</a>' electronic side project Lufthaus on their track \"Immortal.\" Ellis-Bextor closed the year on a rather unexpected note, carried by the popularity of her 2001 single \"Murder on the Dancefloor,\" which experienced a pop culture resurgence after appearing in 2023's cult film Saltburn. The song surged on streaming platforms, while rising on the U.K charts and giving the singer her first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100. ~ Matt Collar, Rovi",

        "biography": "BENEE is the dreamy voice of a disaffected generation who broke through in 2020 with “Supalonely,” her irresistible, four billion streaming alt-pop banger that practically defined the pandemic experience. Twenty-two-year-old Stella Bennett mixes her deeply heartfelt reflections on life in suburban Auckland, New Zealand with offbeat and often whimsical lyrical notions, all produced with a technicolor ear for cooked beats and unpredictable hooks. A fervent online following were drawn to BENEE’s two intriguing EP releases, FIRE ON MARZZ and STELLA &amp; STEVE, before her guest-packed, yet highly personal, Hey u x album was released at the tail end of 2020. The album was a vibrant musical world with guests ranging from Grimes and Lily Allen to Gus Dapperton and Muroki (another New Zealand teen BENEE has since signed to her own label, Olive). It was listed as one of Billboard’s “25 Best Pop Albums of 2020,” noting that BENEE “contemplates the woes of Gen Z with a keen ear for choruses and arrangements that oscillate between indie rock and hyperpop.” Stereogum praised its “quirky but impeccably produced pop music” and Vogue called it “13 tracks of heavenly indie-alt-pop.” A year on, BENEE returns with her 2022 Lychee EP, with her song “Doesn’t Matter” revealing the singer’s journey through the emotional clatter of 2021.The EP release leads into plans for 2022 with the thing that excites Bennett most, a hefty touring schedule. Expect the world to be ready and waiting for her.",

Ranging in age from 16 to 22 and coming from immensely different cultures, the six members of KATSEYE are: DANIELA (USA); LARA (USA); MANON (Switzerland); MEGAN (USA); SOPHIA (Philippines); and YOONCHAE (South Korea). \n\nNow based in Los Angeles, KATSEYE’s members emerged from 120,000 submissions that were winnowed down to a field of 20 contestants who participated in The Debut: Dream Academy, an intensive program developed jointly by HYBE and GEFFEN. Fans got to know the young women over the course of the 2023 audition program, which was seen on YouTube, Weverse and ABEMA (Japan).\n\nKATSEYE released their first EP, SIS (Soft Is Strong), on August 16. The years-long process of creating this one-of-a-kind international girl group is the subject of a Netflix documentary series which premiers August 21.  The series follows 20 contestants from around the world over a year-long journey as they compete to become KATSEYE. With unprecedented access, unfolding over eight episodes, the result is a compelling portrayal of the road to international stardom, including insight into the unique training and development program developed by HYBE and Geffen Records. Directed by Nadia Hallgren (Becoming) and produced by HYBE, Interscope Films and Boardwalk Pictures.",

        "biography": "Muni Long’s wide-eyed R&amp;B is written with pure honesty. In recent years, she has come to bare all of herself in song, like when she was discovered on YouTube as a teen, singing the dictionary, turning random words and definitions into improvised melismatic gold. Later, in early 2022, Muni Long became known to the world by turning the tangible ache of irresistible love into “Hrs and Hrs”—a hypnotic R&amp;B gem she famously wrote while doing dishes. The track soon went on to garner a Platinum certification, as well as over 1.6 million TikTok creates, more than 200 million streams across platforms, and a #16 peak on the Billboard Hot 100. \n\nIt was a fitting introduction to Muni Long as an artist—casual, real, complicated. Every song she shares seems to demonstrate an ever-deepening understanding of the complex emotions of romantic entanglements, and the struggle to find yourself in relationships. She’s become 2022’s breakthrough R&amp;B artist in the process of searching for herself. But in a way, her viral breakout almost felt like destiny—the web was the first place she saw how far her voice could travel. \n\nKnowing she’s capable of writing hit songs in the time it takes to clean her kitchen, she isn’t worried too much about what comes next. She’s hoping that her platform can show other people like her that it’s possible to succeed by being true to yourself. In Muni’s eyes, her rise is proof that Black women are commercially viable in an industry that has traditionally said otherwise.",

        "biography": "Anxious’ second album Bambi arrives this winter on Run For Cover Records. It’s been a whirlwind few years for the Fairfield, Connecticut five-piece – since the release of their debut album Little Green House, there’s been little time for anything other than consistent touring with bands like Hot Mulligan, Drug Church and The Wonder Years. Somewhere during that endless grind, vocalist Grady Allen was sitting in a hotel room and stumbled upon a name typed into a long-forgotten memo on his phone: Bambi. “We should have named the band Bambi,” he recalls admitting to his bandmates. Bambi stuck with the band after that night and eventually it evolved from a “what-if” into the name of Anxious’ second full-length album.\n\nBambi is a record of remarkable growth, depth, ambition, and energy. It takes all the unsolvable and unavoidable problems of exiting adolescence and makes them resonate in urgent and authentic new ways. The album has deep roots in the storied lineage of Northeast tri-state hardcore and emo, but it also fully embraces the widescreen alternative rock songwriting at which Anxious have previously only hinted. It’s a statement of purpose, the kind of album that comes from a band reconciling where they’ve been with where they want to go. Bambi is the sound of Anxious putting everything on the line–and coming out on the other side better than ever.",

        "biography": "Paula Tsui is a beloved Cantopop singer whose career spans several decades. Born in Wuhan, Hubei, China, on January 1, 1948, she made her recording debut in 1969 in association with Crown Records. In subsequent years she would record albums for labels including Man Chi Records (1971-1973), Wing Hang Records (1973-1978), Sony Records (1978-1981), Contec Records (1982-1986), and PolyGram Records (1986-1990). She was also long affiliated with the Hong Kong television station TVB. Though she stopped releasing albums of new material in the 1990s, a steady stream of compilations was released, and she continued to perform live. Most famously, she performed 43 concerts in 37 days at Hong Kong Coliseum in 1992. ~ Jason Birchmeier, Rovi",

        "biography": "If you’ve ever watched David Lynch’s classic 2001 film Mulholland Dr., you might just recognize the title of Pærish’s third full-length, You’re In Both Dreams (And You’re Scared).\n\nYou can hear that in these songs—and to that extent, this album disproves the very anxieties and insecurities that inspired it. Pærish vocalist/guitarist Mathias Court thinks this new album is “heavier, noisier and way more sad than the previous one,” the result of writing much more spontaneous songs. He’s not wrong. It opens with the solemn, heavy beauty of “Sequoia”, a track that’s simultaneously comforting and frenzied, beautiful and harrowing. It’s on the next track, “Daydreaming”, that the crunching, heavy riffs Pærish have made their own first appear in full force on this record, but afterwards they’re found throughout. “Amanita” is an overwhelming surge of tortured emotion that pulsates menacingly, the melancholy “It Only Bothers You” feels like it carries the entire burden of humanity on its shoulders, while “Houses of American Style”, “Brian Wilfuzz” and “Worry” all sound like timeless classics from American alternative music’s heyday – albeit imbued with Pærish’s own distinct sparkle. It’s not all crushing riffs, however – in addition to “Sequoia”, “The Luck You Had” and final song “My Every Step” are moments of tender grace and beauty. It all combines to make this the album Pærish have been striving to make.",

        "biography": "Harry Styles’ third solo album, Harry&#39;s House, is breaking new ground for one of the most creative forces in pop music, a star who keeps refusing to stand still. It’s a deeply personal statement from an artist who has never sounded this joyous, this confident, this fearless in facing the future. Harry’s House debuted at Number One on the Billboard Charts and moved 521,00 equivalent album units in its first week. Harry&#39;s House is currently the best-selling album of 2022.\n \n“As It Was,” the critically acclaimed lead single, dropped on April 1st and became an instant record-breaking hit, debuting at Number One in both the U.S. and the U.K. “As It Was” became the most-streamed song in the U.S. in a single day in Spotify history and the most-streamed song globally in a single day of 2022.\n \nThe British singer-songwriter dropped his blockbuster sophomore album Fine Line on Columbia Records in December 2019. It combined critical acclaim with record-setting commercial success, debuting at Number One on the Billboard charts. “Watermelon Sugar” became his first Number One single, winning Styles his first Grammy, for Best Pop Solo Performance and a 2021 BRIT Award for Best British Single. When Rolling Stone released its comprehensive list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, Fine Line was the most recent album honored, taking its place in history.\n \nHarry is taking Love on Tour worldwide through 2022, in the aftermath of his historic Coachella set, in support of Harry’s House.",

        "biography": "Singaporean singer Tanya Chua became a star throughout much of Asia around the turn of the century with a combination of Mandarin- and English-language albums. Born in Singapore on January 28, 1975, the multilingual singer made her recording debut in 1997 with the English-language album Bored. The following year she became the first Singaporean to win the Asia Song Festival and was offered a recording contract with Universal Music Taiwan. Her Mandarin-language debut, Breathe (1999), was well received critically but didn't propel her to stardom as expected. Stardom, particularly in Taiwan, came several years later when she switched to Warner Music and changed her style, resulting in Stranger (2003), her popular breakthrough. ~ Jason Birchmeier, Rovi",

        "biography": "From start to finish, Let’s Start Degeneracy marks a liberated new chapter for Microwave, one unbound by realities other than their own. Recorded between Atlanta and Nashville and later mixed by Josh Wilbur (Korn, Bad Religion) and mastered by Brad Blackwood (Maroon 5, Lamb of God), the long-awaited fourth full-length record from Microwave, is a trip. Its title, taken from a conservative politician&#39;s take on drugs in 1970, captures the band&#39;s newfound liberated spirit, and its tracks play by no one&#39;s rules but their own. At various points the Atlanta trio of vocalist/guitarist Nathan Hardy, bassist Tyler Hill, and drummer Timothy “Tito” Pittard pull together a multitude of influences ranging from ambient pop and R&amp;B to psychedelia and yes, even Sublime.\n\nLyrically, Let&#39;s Start Degeneracy is loaded with revelations, some of which came to Hardy after experiences with ayahuasca in Peru with Tito. As the pandemic wound down, the two reconvened with bassist/vocalist Tyler Hill and together, found their way back to being Microwave again. \n\n“It’s about letting go of attachments and behaviors that aren’t serving you and trying to shake off your programming and not be motivated by fear and guilt and shame,” says Hardy. “It’s about learning to be happy and take care of yourself.”",

        "biography": "St. Louis-raised, Atlanta-based producer Metro Boomin is the master of a street-oriented sound that is jet-black and low-gloss, sufficiently reflected in his alias. Within five years of his first output with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, he amassed well over a dozen Top 20 R&B/hip-hop hits and a similar quantity of gold and platinum RIAA certifications. Since his early half-decade roll of success working with the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3aGFCoR8xGN6DKwvdzeSja\">iLoveMakonnen</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6oMuImdp5ZcFhWP0ESe6mG\">Migos</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:246dkjvS1zLTtiykXe5h60\">Post Malone</a> -- with \"Honest,\" \"Tuesday,\" \"Jumpman,\" \"Bad and Boujee,\" and \"Congratulations\" among his biggest hits -- Metro has remained a marquee name. He crowned the Billboard 200 with Not All Heroes Wear Capes (2018), his first solo album, and made return trips to the top spot with Savage Mode II (a 2020 duo LP with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a>) and his Grammy-nominated sophomore set, Heroes & Villains (2022). He branched out to film in 2023, helming the soundtrack to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. WE DON'T TRUST YOU and WE STILL DON'T TRUST YOU, his first two full albums co-billed with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, topped the charts in 2024.\r\n\nMetro Boomin got into production during his early teens and also rapped, though he eventually opted to devote all his energy to beatmaking. He connected with artists through social media, and prior to graduating high school, he'd logged thousands of miles on round trips to Atlanta, where he worked with the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:0t5qZrvVCo9YIUT87SQrTn\">OJ da Juiceman</a> and, eventually, <a href=\"spotify:artist:13y7CgLHjMVRMDqxdx0Xdo\">Gucci Mane</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>. Metro fulfilled his mother's dream with his acceptance to the conveniently located Morehouse College, but he dropped out and invested more in making music than in studying business management.\r\n\nIn 2013, Metro's name was on Billboard charts for the first time as the producer of <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>'s \"Karate Chop\" and \"Honest.\" Just after the latter single was officially released, he self-released 19 & Boomin. Once <a href=\"spotify:artist:3aGFCoR8xGN6DKwvdzeSja\">iLoveMakonnen</a>'s \"Tuesday,\" another early triumph, hit the R&B/hip-hop Top Ten the following year, Metro was a constant presence near the top of that chart. <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>'s \"Jumpman\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>'s \"Low Life\" were among the early 2016 hits, followed later in the year by \"X\" -- taken from Savage Mode, his self-released EP made with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a> -- and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6oMuImdp5ZcFhWP0ESe6mG\">Migos</a>' \"Bad and Boujee,\" which eventually topped the R&B/hip-hop and pop charts. \r\n\nAmong Metro Boomin's subsequent hits throughout a notable 2017 were <a href=\"spotify:artist:0c173mlxpT3dSFRgMO8XPh\">Big Sean</a>'s \"Bounce Back,\" <a href=\"spotify:artist:246dkjvS1zLTtiykXe5h60\">Post Malone</a>'s \"Congratulations,\" <a href=\"spotify:artist:46SHBwWsqBkxI7EeeBEQG7\">Kodak Black</a>'s \"Tunnel Vision,\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>'s \"Mask Off.\" The year remained a busy one, as Metro later released a trio of collaborative mixtapes: Perfect Timing (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7rkW85dBwwrJtlHRDkJDAC\">NAV</a>), Without Warning (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4DdkRBBYG6Yk9Ka8tdJ9BW\">Offset</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a>), and Double or Nothing (<a href=\"spotify:artist:0c173mlxpT3dSFRgMO8XPh\">Big Sean</a>). The following year brought even more success for Metro, not only for his input on notable albums by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a> but also for his own project, Not All Heroes Wear Capes. The album topped the Billboard 200 upon release in November 2018 and yielded a pair of platinum singles with \"No Complaints,\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:4DdkRBBYG6Yk9Ka8tdJ9BW\">Offset</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>, and \"Space Cadet,\" on which Metro was joined by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hlmm7s2ICUX0LVIhVFlZQ\">Gunna</a>. \r\n\nIn 2020, Metro Boomin resumed his partnership with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a> and delivered another Billboard 200 topper, Savage Mode II. Four of its tracks, including \"Glock in My Lap,\" hit the Top 40. Metro scored a third Billboard 200 album in 2022 with his sophomore album, Heroes & Villains. The set contained another quartet of Top 40 entries, most notably the chart-topping platinum hit \"Creepin',\" a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a> that interpolated <a href=\"spotify:artist:4BIQA9vRkqXEnA2twmq7mU\">Mario Winans</a>' \"I Don't Wanna Know.\" He kept the train of number ones rolling in 2023 with the soundtrack to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which arrived that June alongside the animated blockbuster. In addition to featuring the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4DdkRBBYG6Yk9Ka8tdJ9BW\">Offset</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:53KwLdlmrlCelAZMaLVZqU\">James Blake</a>, and many more, the compilation also included the hit single \"Calling\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1zNqQNIdeOUZHb8zbZRFMX\">Swae Lee</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7rkW85dBwwrJtlHRDkJDAC\">Nav</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:31W5EY0aAly4Qieq6OFu6I\">A Boogie wit da Hoodie</a>. Heroes & Villains received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, while Metro Boomin himself was nominated for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. After contributing heavily to <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a>'s chart-topping 2024 album, American Dream, Metro Boomin teamed up with longtime collaborator <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a> for the full-length WE DON'T TRUST YOU. The album topped the Billboard 200 in its opening week, while the single \"Like That\" was also a number one hit. Three weeks after the album was released, it was followed by WE STILL DON'T TRUST YOU, a distinct album and not a deluxe edition of the first collaboration. Once again, it reached number one. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi",

        "biography": "yeule is the Singapore-born, nonbinary musician, performance artist, and painter also known as Nat Ćmiel. First self-releasing songs at age 14, they have since emerged as a cult art icon, whose experimental pop songs of emotional excavation and self-reclamation have attracted a dedicated following of fellow outsiders who seek catharsis from physical and mental struggle. A chameleonic auteur guided by a multidisciplinary ethos, they craft entire worlds and personas through their music, weaving together everything from the classical canon, hypermodern internet cultures, academic theory, the esoteric, and their own carnal desires.\n\nFrom cathartic punk riffs to ethereal electronics, yeule crafted Soft Scars, their debut album on Ninja Tune released in September 2023. On the blistering project, there is the anatomy of their long held emotional wounds, making for their most penetrating and daring work yet. By liberating their repressed memories through images of blood, flames, porcelain, and angel wings, they honour the way that pain has shaped their past selves and built their instinct for self-protection. \n\nDespite their total isolation and alienation of self, they plugged into the internet and somehow still manage to obtain a degree in Fine Arts from Central Saint Martins College in London. They poured out their anguish through sonic crystallisations, handwritten and subversively painted dissections of what the yeule project embues artistically for Ćmiel.",

        "biography": "Chart-topping and influential rapper Future is known for a uniquely fluid and melodic yet mumbling vocal style. He busted out of the South at the dawn of the 2010s with a flurry of mixtapes, high-charting albums, certified platinum singles, and contributions to several other hits as a featured artist, then continued to hover at the top of his game, both commercially and creatively, in the years that followed. After he scored his first hit via a guest spot on <a href=\"spotify:artist:4utmqQVLD5gB15ezM0mYuI\">YC</a>'s \"Racks\" (2011), Future quickly became a key factor in Atlanta's grip on the Billboard charts, often with production support from fellow ATL natives and dwellers such as <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0NWbwDZY1VkRqFafuQm6wk\">Mike WiLL Made-It</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:655963AgkTZeYUvCyodCIL\">Sonny Digital</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:23DYJsw4uSCguIqiTIDtcN\">Southside</a>. By the end of 2017, Future had amassed 32 Top Ten R&B/hip-hop hits as a headliner and featured artist. Meanwhile, 11 full-length projects -- including an all-platinum run of DS2 (2015), Evol (2016), and Future (2017) -- debuted within the Top Five of the Billboard 200. Future capped off the 2010s by adding to his Top 20 tally with the Grammy-winning \"King's Dead,\" co-producing a remake of Super Fly, and hitting the top of the Billboard 200 again with The Wizrd (2019). He has since returned to the throne with several projects, including High Off Life (2020), WE DON'T TRUST YOU/WE STILL DON'T TRUST YOU (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>, 2024), and Mixtape Pluto (2024).\r\n\nBorn <a href=\"spotify:artist:36rXTEX3RKUx0gsSflnFHd\">Nayvadius Wilburn</a>, Future grew up in his city's Zone 6 section with roots in the ATL's <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ElKnrmCBRnIjTrrzkAL42\">Dungeon Family</a>, who dubbed him \"the Future.\" Mentored by cousin and fellow <a href=\"spotify:artist:1ElKnrmCBRnIjTrrzkAL42\">Dungeon Family</a> member Rico Wade of the revered <a href=\"spotify:artist:7qvIiE9YmyP02NLjufTxkX\">Organized Noize</a>, Future released his first mixtapes in 2010 and early 2011, which left him poised for a mainstream breakthrough. A few months after the January 2011 release of his third mixtape, Future was featured on <a href=\"spotify:artist:4utmqQVLD5gB15ezM0mYuI\">YC</a>'s \"Racks,\" a single that bubbled up to the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. Shortly thereafter, the rapper signed with major label <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Epic%22\">Epic</a>, and \"Tony Montana,\" his proper debut single, subsequently peaked just outside the Top 20. Its parent album, Pluto, landed the following April and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, supported by the number two R&B/hip-hop hit \"Turn on the Lights,\" which earned Future his first RIAA platinum certification. No new studio albums were released in 2013, but Future's year was productive as a guest artist. He appeared on four Top Ten R&B/hip-hop hits that went either gold or platinum: <a href=\"spotify:artist:55Aa2cqylxrFIXC767Z865\">Lil Wayne</a>'s \"Love Me,\" <a href=\"spotify:artist:31HjiqargV4NAw4GZqUale\">Ace Hood</a>'s \"Bugatti,\" <a href=\"spotify:artist:6h2J3dxLnTyURwIUBumKog\">Rich Gang</a>'s \"Tapout,\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0T5OJgMVjKIX3b3W3ekqOl\">Rocko</a>'s \"U.O.E.N.O.\" He also appeared on a remix of \"Body Party\" by <a href=\"spotify:artist:2NdeV5rLm47xAvogXrYhJX\">Ciara</a>, who became his fiancée that October. \r\n\nFuture's second full-length album, Honest, was issued in April 2014. It earned both critical acclaim and popular success and peaked at number two. Two singles from the album, \"Move That Dope\" (featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0ONHkAv9pCAFxb0zJwDNTy\">Pusha T</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4XvaV0jFnwEthusiVdEBHK\">Casino</a>) and \"I Won\" (co-produced by frequent collaborator <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a> and featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>), went gold. A few months after the album's release, Future and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2NdeV5rLm47xAvogXrYhJX\">Ciara</a>'s split was made public. Late 2014 and early 2015 brought three mixtapes and another hit single, \"Fuck Up Some Commas.\" They primed Future fans for third album DS2, which debuted at number one in July 2015. Only two months later, What a Time to Be Alive, a mixtape collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>, reached the same spot.\r\n\nIn early 2016, Future released Evol, which arrived unannounced but still debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Its single \"Low Life,\" a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a>, quickly went double platinum. In November of that year, Future issued another <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>-assisted hit, \"Used to This,\" from his Beast Mode 16 mixtape. The roll continued through 2017 with a pair of full-lengths, Future and HNDRXX. Issued during consecutive weeks that February, the two albums kept Future's streak of number ones intact, while the former, featuring the Top Ten pop hit \"Mask Off,\" became the rapper's third consecutive platinum solo full-length. Later that year, he hopped onto <a href=\"spotify:artist:7c0XG5cIJTrrAgEC3ULPiq\">Ty Dolla $ign</a>'s \"Don't Judge Me\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1zNqQNIdeOUZHb8zbZRFMX\">Swae Lee</a> before issuing Super Slimey, a joint effort with <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>.\r\n\nFuture followed with a pair of soundtrack contributions in 2018. First, he joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:28ExwzUQsvgJooOI0X1mr3\">Jay Rock</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:53KwLdlmrlCelAZMaLVZqU\">James Blake</a> for a hit single from the Black Panther soundtrack, \"King's Dead,\" and a few months later released \"No Shame\" from Superfly. He not only contributed to the soundtrack but presented it as well, and was among the film's co-producers. Future started 2019 with the release of his seventh album, The Wizrd, which became his fifth solo chart-topper (and sixth overall). The set featured appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hlmm7s2ICUX0LVIhVFlZQ\">Gunna</a>, while <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY\">Travis Scott</a> assisted \"First Off,\" one of its three charting singles. Less than a month after the release of that album, Future won a Grammy for Best Rap Performance for his contribution to \"King's Dead.\" He returned later in 2019 with the darker and more pained Save Me, a seven-track EP that reached number five.\r\n\nFuture got an early start on the new decade in January 2020 with \"Life Is Good,\" another <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> collaboration. The single became his second Top Ten pop hit as a headliner and reached quadruple-platinum status by the time he issued High Off Life in May. Originally intended to be titled after the preceding hit -- Future opted to go with a less contentious title due to the COVID-19 pandemic -- High Off Life entered the Billboard 200 at number one. Among its follow-up singles were \"Tycoon\" and \"Trillionaire,\" the latter featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:7wlFDEWiM5OoIAt8RSli8b\">YoungBoy Never Broke Again</a>. Before the year was over, Future teamed up with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4O15NlyKLIASxsJ0PrXPfz\">Lil Uzi Vert</a> for the collaborative album Pluto x Baby Pluto. The record was released in November 2020 and debuted at number two on the Billboard chart. \r\n\nFuture remained relatively quiet in 2021, but he returned in 2022 for his ninth solo LP, I NEVER LIKED YOU, which once again topped the U.S. charts. WE DON'T TRUST YOU, Future's first album co-billed with longtime producer <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>, appeared in 2024, and was another chart-topping success. Three weeks after it was released, it was followed by WE STILL DON'T TRUST YOU, a distinct album and not a deluxe edition of the first collaboration. Once again, it reached number one. The feature-free Mixtape Pluto became Future's third chart-topping release of 2024. ~ David Jeffries & Andy Kellman, Rovi",

        "biography": "b. Glenroy Ernest Smith, c.1948, Jamaica, West Indies. Smith initially enjoyed notoriety when his single ‘Pitta Patta’, backed with ‘Lichfield Gardens’, topped the Jamaican charts in 1973, utilizing Lee Perry’s ‘musical transplant’ rhythm. The song was voted as the best song of the year in Jamaica by Swing magazine. The lyrics were also adapted by Lloyd Charmers for his lewd ‘Big Eight’, marketed as the reggae alternative to Judge Dread’s hit. An album followed, with Smith covering ‘I Love You To Want Me’ and ‘Help Me Make It Through The Night’, both successfully recorded by John Holt. In 1974 Smith followed the hit with ‘Duppy Or A Gunman’ and the equally popular ‘Key Card’, echoing the patois style made popular by Pluto. ‘Duppy Or A Gunman’ was successfully covered by Inner Circle and interest in the original was regenerated 10 years later with Yellowman. Smith became involved in the Wildflower collective, known as XYZ productions, alongside Lloyd Charmers, where they released a number of chart-topping hits including Ken Boothe’s interpretation of ‘Everything I Own’, which was an international bestseller. In addition to his own recording, Smith was also responsible for Tinga Stewart’s Jamaican Song Festival winner, ‘Play De Music’. Johnny Nash had recorded the disdained Celebrate Life which led the singer on a trip to Jamaica seeking inspiration. The result was Smith’s composition ‘Tears On My Pillow (I Can’t Stand It)’ which topped the UK chart in June 1975. By 1976 Smith’s style was no longer in vogue, although he continued to enjoy popularity with more mature listeners, releasing a number of middle-of-the-road and gospel-influenced albums. In 1980 he recorded a version of Bob Marley’s ‘Bend Down Low’, produced with Lloyd Charmers.",

Their 1984 hit &#39;Smalltown Boy&#39; remains one of the most hauntingly evocative songs about the constant battle of growing up in a community hostile to homosexuality and the desire to find refuge in a distant, more permissive metropolis.\nKeyboardists Steve Bronski, Larry Steinbackek and singer Jimmy Somerville formed the group in 1983 when they were sharing in a flat in Brixton, South London. The musical alchemy between the three was instant and they were signed to London Records after only playing nine gigs, with debut single, &#39;Smalltown Boy&#39;, reaching #3 in the UK chart a matter of months later.\nSomerville was an outspokenly political pop star and his remarkable counter-tenor provided the dazzling centrepiece of the band’s debut album, 1984’s The Age Of Consent.\nSomerville left the band in 1985 to form The Communards with Richard Coles, who had previously performed with Bronski Beat, and Bronski and Steinbackek recruited singer John Foster as the group’s new frontman, scoring a Top 3 hit in November that year and their second album, 1986’s Truthdare Doubledare, refined their HI-NRG sound.\nThe band disbanded shortly afterwards and Bronski went on to from a new line up in the mid 90s, while Somerville continued to pursue a successful solo career after the dissolution of The Communards at the end of the 80s.",

        "biography": "Real Estate helped usher in a warm, hazy style of indie rock that came into prominence in the late 2000s and continue to ply a similar sound, though with a more mature outlook. The band's breezy melodies, jangly guitars, relaxed vocals, and generally laid-back approach to songcraft hid musical complexities on standout albums like 2014's Atlas. As the years went on, their original lineup splintered and new songs explored getting older, parenthood, and a new wealth of  topics, still delivered in the band's reserved, mellow style on albums released in the 2020s like The Main Thing and Daniel.\r\n\nReal Estate was formed in Ridgewood by lead singer/guitarist <a href=\"spotify:artist:4JuWruv1jBeWne0sJTUH3k\">Martin Courtney</a> (Predator Vision and formerly <a href=\"spotify:artist:5lJ4XQ2hlPlxACN7q3xKL1\">Titus Andronicus</a>), guitarist Matthew Mondanile (<a href=\"spotify:artist:5FQbU5Lrb4pFcW45ZgZzMx\">Ducktails</a>), bassist <a href=\"spotify:artist:5SeeIpngflK0Sn481V9Rhc\">Alex Bleeker</a> (<a href=\"spotify:artist:2YpXA8wolWBe3jEuktmX5d\">Alex Bleeker & the Freaks</a>), and drummer Etienne Duguay (Predator Vision). The foursome had played together -- including in a <a href=\"spotify:artist:3jOstUTkEu2JkjvRdBA5Gu\">Weezer</a> cover band -- during high school, but didn't become Real Estate until <a href=\"spotify:artist:4JuWruv1jBeWne0sJTUH3k\">Courtney</a> returned to the Garden State after attending college in Olympia, Washington. After forming in the summer of 2008, the band began playing live that fall and released the \"Suburban Beverage\" 7\", which introduced Real Estate's brand of surfy, lo-fi pop, early in 2009. A song on the Underwater Peoples Records Showcase and the Fake Blues EP appeared that summer. The band spent the fall touring with Girls before their self-titled debut was released by <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Woodsist%22\">Woodsist</a>. \r\n\nThe quartet joined the <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Domino+Records%22\">Domino Records</a> roster in 2011 for its sophomore effort, Days, which hit the shelves and the Billboard charts in the rock, alternative, independent, and vinyl albums categories. It reached number 52 on the Billboard 200. Shortly following its release, the band went through a lineup change with Duguay dropping out; he was replaced by drummer Jackson Pollis. The group was also joined at that point by auxiliary member Jonah Maurer on keyboards and additional guitars. This new assemblage of Real Estate toured feverishly for the well-received Days, though by their return in 2014 with third album Atlas, Maurer had been replaced by Matt Kallman. That LP went on to rank higher on all the same charts, landing in the Billboard 200's Top 40. Following a short break for other projects, including <a href=\"spotify:artist:4JuWruv1jBeWne0sJTUH3k\">Courtney</a>'s solo debut, in May of 2016 Real Estate announced that Mondanile was leaving the band to focus on <a href=\"spotify:artist:5FQbU5Lrb4pFcW45ZgZzMx\">Ducktails</a>. He was replaced by <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pcVPO1Dc2LkIJZuQohg9k\">Julian Lynch</a>, and the quintet of <a href=\"spotify:artist:4JuWruv1jBeWne0sJTUH3k\">Courtney</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5SeeIpngflK0Sn481V9Rhc\">Bleeker</a>, Pollis, Kallman, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pcVPO1Dc2LkIJZuQohg9k\">Lynch</a> released In Mind in March 2017. Three years later they returned with their fifth studio album The Main Thing, which explored themes of growing up mixed with a healthy fear of an oncoming apocalypse. The Main Thing was preceded by first single \"Paper Cup,\"  which featured guest vocals from Amelia Meath of <a href=\"spotify:artist:39vA9YljbnOApXKniLWBZv\">Sylvan Esso</a>. Pollis left the band in 2020 and the next year the Half a Human EP gathered together material that the band had begun recording during the sessions for The Main Thing and finished later. Drummer Sammi Niss stepped in to replace Pollis, and this lineup of Real Estate recorded sixth studio album Daniel. The album was released in February of 2024. ~ Heather Phares & Marcy Donelson, Rovi",

        "biography": "Man/Woman/Chainsaw are Billy Ward (vocals, guitars), Emmie-Mae Avery (vocals,keys/synths), Vera Leppänen (vocals, bass), Clio Harwood (violin) and Lola Cherry (drums). \n\nA precociously talented band from London, who recently celebrated their 100th gig. Since their debut at 16 years old and across three singles, the band have proven themselves as one of the most exciting and unpredictable young acts in the capital, both joyous and raucous in equal measures.\n\nThe band truly come of age with their debut EP, “Eazy Peazy”. Recorded with Gilla Band’s Daniel Fox at Echo Zoo studio in Eastbourne, the group present us with cinematic arrangements, mauled by moments of cacophony; the band’s Billy Ward says of their writing process,“we thrive on the thin line between pretty and noisy, often trying to jump between the two-it’s that chaos that excites us.”\n\nFrom the driving immediacy of opener “The Boss”, to the robust backbone of “Sports Day”, to the theatrical beauty of “Grow A Tongue In Time” and orchestral highlight “Ode To Clio”, the six track EP captures all the cerebral intensity, and celebratory melody, of the Man/Woman/Chainsaw live performance. It signals the start proper for a band who have been allowed to experiment, given the time to find their sound in a vibrant, supportive DIY community, and who will surely finish the year ready to take on the next with unbridled confidence. With boundless potential like theirs, you’d not bet against them.",

On Where we’ve been, Where we go from here, their full-length debut release on ATO Records, the band merges elements of post-punk &amp; chamber-pop &amp; experimental rock, magnifying their music’s exhilarating power with a steady barrage of spirited gang vocals. Poetic, explosive, &amp; sublimely raw in feeling, the album brings an equally visceral intensity to brutally heavy anthems &amp; heart-on-sleeve ballads alike, creating an immediate outlet for the most unwieldy emotions.\n \nFormed in 2019, Friko soon began taking the stage at legendary Chicago venues like the Metro, Empty Bottle and Schubas Tavern, self-releasing their acclaimed debut EP Whenever Forever in 2022 and making their festival debut at Bonnaroo the following spring. Known for their high-energy live show, Friko aim to deliver a live experience that’s fantastically disorienting in its emotional arc. Mastered by Heba Kadry (Björk, Big Thief) and engineered by Jack Henry and Scott Tallarida, Where we’ve been, Where we go from here embodies a sonic complexity befitting of a band that names Romantic-era classical music and the more primal edges of art-rock among their inspirations. Friko hopes that their music’s emotional potency might have a galvanizing impact on audiences. Niko says, “I want our music to pick people up, so that they can actually go out and do something with whatever they’re feeling.”",

        "biography": "With a distinctive sound developed through tireless attention to musicality and artistry, Stick Figure has redefined American reggae music with his latest album, Wisdom, released on September 9th, 2022. As with his previous releases, Wisdom was written, produced and recorded by Scott Woodruff, a self-taught musician, at Stick Figure-owned Great Stone Studios in Oakland, CA, former home of Green Day.\n \nWisdom is Stick Figure’s seventh album and follows the unprecedented success of 2019’s World on Fire, which peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Top 200, #6 overall Top albums, #1 Independent, and #1 Reggae album. World on Fire has sold over 300,000 copies including streaming equivalents, according to Nielsen soundscan data. Stick Figure’s catalog has now sold well over one million copies and been streamed over three billion times. \n\nWisdom is a journey and a search for what matters in life–a search for meaning, purpose, place and belonging. Wisdom is a code to live by where we can accept that it is ok to start over, to make mistakes, to love, and to feel pain. It is a reminder to focus on the little things that bring joy and know that all of it is a part of our individual story. It also shows us that we should have some fun doing it all! In signature Stick Figure style, Wisdom can bring peace and happiness in the dark moments as well as in the good times, and the benefits of the music can stay with the listener long after the record has stopped spinning.",

        "biography": "Over the past year, GRAMMY-nominated Vermont singer &amp; songwriter Noah Kahan has exploded from his New England roots into the global mainstream and has been touted as one of this year’s biggest and best new artists. At the core of his music are vulnerable lyrics and an unfiltered yet relatable honesty, as the critically acclaimed artist pens songs straight from the heart and cracks jokes with his signature, self-deprecating sense of humor. Across his three albums and an EP, Kahan has garnered global renown for his singular mix of Folk, Americana, and Rock, landing more than five billion streams, a Double Platinum Certification for his hit single “Stick Season,” and collaborations with Post Malone, Kacey Musgraves, Brandi Carlile, and more. His widely adored, Platinum-Certified album, Stick Season, is inspired by his New England roots and earliest musical inspirations—from Paul Simon to Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens)—conveying a vivid representation of what he loves, fears, and struggles with most passionately. Noah embarked on his sold-out “Stick Season Tour” across North America since the album’s release last year, selling over half-a-million tickets and performing in the biggest venues of his career, with stadium and arena dates already sold-out for his 2024 world tour. Noah has dropped the final release of the Stick Season series—Stick Season (Forever), led by his new single “Forever”—further solidifying himself as one of the most successful breakout artists of the year.",

        "biography": "One of the most acclaimed artists of his generation, hip-hop or otherwise, Kendrick Lamar is known for his top-tier lyricism, virtuosic microphone command, and sharp conceptual vision. His talents have translated to a rare combination of continuous chart feats and critical acclaim, plus respect and support from the rappers who paved the way for his advancement. The Compton native started in his teens and hit his creative and commercial stride in the 2010s, during which he authored the multi-platinum good kid, m.A.A.d city (2012), followed up with the Grammy-winning To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), and scaled another new height with the Grammy- and Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN. (2017). All three displayed an unmatched mix of inventive wordplay and riveting narratives with an assertion of artistic dominance, examination of internal conflict, and upliftment of community all centered. Those qualities were also exemplified in seven concurrent Top 40 singles that included \"Swimming Pools (Drank),\" \"i,\" and the Hot 100-topping \"HUMBLE.\" Lamar's screenplay-level detail on those recordings was enriched by a shifting collective of associates, many of whom -- from inspirations <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a> and MC Eiht to peers such as Sounwave, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7MNEVabc4cs19CbzAFZmXz\">Terrace Martin</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4frXpPxQQZwbCu3eTGnZEw\">Thundercat</a> -- likewise represent Los Angeles. The rapper's cinematic and collaborative inclinations inevitably attracted the mainstream film industry, leading to an executive-production role on Black Panther: The Album (2018), the source of three additional Top 40 hits. Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), fueled by intense self-analysis, became Lamar's sixth number one on the Billboard 200 despite containing his most challenging and confrontational work. The lean surprise release GNX (2024) capped a year in which Lamar topped the Hot 100 again with \"Like That\" (a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>) and \"Not Like Us\" (the peak of a public feud with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>).  \r\n\nCompton, California native Kendrick Lamar Duckworth grew up immersed in hip-hop culture and surrounded by gang activity. As a youngster, he gradually discovered an aptitude for writing stories, poems, and lyrics, which naturally led to rapping. He made a name for himself as K. Dot. At the age of 16 in 2003, he issued his debut mixtape, The Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year. While it merely hinted at the potential of the then-teenager, it was impressive enough to catch the attention of <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Top+Dawg+Entertainment%22\">Top Dawg Entertainment</a> and led to a long-term association with the label that steadily propelled his career. Training Day, the <a href=\"spotify:artist:28ExwzUQsvgJooOI0X1mr3\">Jay Rock</a> collaboration No Sleep 'til NYC, and C4, issued from 2005 through 2009, likewise preceded Lamar's decision to go by his first and middle names. The last of the three was issued the same year he became part of <a href=\"spotify:artist:7a9KRWdaSZktpGGnWndzbC\">Black Hippy</a>, a group whose members -- including fellow <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22TDE%22\">TDE</a> artists <a href=\"spotify:artist:0g9vAlRPK9Gt3FKCekk4TW\">Ab-Soul</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:28ExwzUQsvgJooOI0X1mr3\">Jay Rock</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5IcR3N7QB1j6KBL8eImZ8m\">ScHoolboy Q</a> -- frequently appeared on one another's mixtapes and albums. \r\n\nThe first tape credited to Kendrick Lamar was Overly Dedicated, released in September 2010. Also the rapper's first commercial release, it reached enough listeners to enter Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. After XXL magazine selected him for the 2011 Freshman Class feature, Lamar released his first official album, Section.80, that July, and crossed into the Billboard 200, reaching number 113. With deeper conceptual narratives and sharpened melodic hooks, as well as comparative multidimensional development from primary producer Sounwave, the set acted as a kind of warning flare for Lamar's mainstream rap dominance. In addition to the dozens of tracks he had appeared on by then, Lamar had the support of veteran West Coast stars as well. During a concert later in 2011, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG\">Snoop Dogg</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0NbfKEOTQCcwd6o7wSDOHI\">Game</a> dubbed him \"The New King of the West Coast,\" a notion <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dre</a> endorsed more significantly by signing Lamar to his <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Interscope%22\">Interscope</a>-affiliated <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Aftermath%22\">Aftermath</a> label. \r\n\nLamar's major-label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city, was released in October 2012 and entered the Billboard 200 at number two. Three of its singles -- \"Swimming Pools (Drank),\" \"Poetic Justice,\" and \"Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe\" -- reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart and went Top 40 pop. More significantly, the album showcased Lamar as an exceptional storyteller capable of making compelling concept albums. It led to Grammy nominations in four categories: Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Best Rap Album, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (for \"Now or Never,\" a deluxe edition bonus cut featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:1XkoF8ryArs86LZvFOkbyr\">Mary J. Blige</a>). <a href=\"spotify:artist:360IAlyVv4PCEVjgyMZrxK\">Miguel</a>'s \"How Many Drinks?\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:13ubrt8QOOCPljQ2FL1Kca\">A$AP Rocky</a>'s \"Fuckin' Problems,\" two tracks on which Lamar made guest appearances, were nominated as well.  \r\n\nRather than rest, Lamar remained active during 2013-2014, touring as well as appearing on tracks by the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5INjqkS1o8h1imAzPqGZBb\">Tame Impala</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0A0FS04o6zMoto8OKPsDwY\">YG</a>, and fellow <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Top+Dawg%22\">Top Dawg</a> affiliate <a href=\"spotify:artist:7tYKF4w9nC0nq9CsPZTHyP\">SZA</a>. The proud single \"i\" was released in September of the latter year, became Lamar's fourth Top 40 single, and won Grammys for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song. Still rolling, he announced in early 2015 that his third album, To Pimp a Butterfly, would be out in March with tracks featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG\">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4jCbgl5Dmt3uOh8WRQfpPs\">Bilal</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4frXpPxQQZwbCu3eTGnZEw\">Thundercat</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2GVBp7QyHckoOg7rYkLvrA\">George Clinton</a>. A technical error caused the digital version to be released eight days early, but the LP nonetheless topped the Billboard 200 with sales of 325,000 copies within its first week. It made numerous best-of lists at the end of the year and won the Grammy for Best Rap Album. The defiant and life-affirming \"Alright,\" which was quickly adopted by the Black Lives Matter activist movement, along with another single, \"These Walls,\" took awards for Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Riding high on his wins and a striking Grammy ceremony performance, Lamar followed up in March 2016 with untitled unmastered., consisting of demos recorded during the previous three years. Like the preceding release, it debuted at number one, and seamlessly synthesized beatmaking and traditional musicianship from the likes of Sounwave, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7MNEVabc4cs19CbzAFZmXz\">Terrace Martin</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4frXpPxQQZwbCu3eTGnZEw\">Thundercat</a>. Within a month, Lamar added to his ever-lengthening discography of featured appearances with his contribution to <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m\">Beyoncé</a>'s \"Freedom.\"\r\n\nLed by \"HUMBLE.,\" his first number one pop hit, DAMN. arrived in April 2017 and likewise entered the Billboard 200 at the top. Remarkably, all 14 of the album's songs entered the Hot 100, and it was certified multi-platinum within three months. Among the contributors were <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:51Blml2LZPmy7TTiAg47vQ\">U2</a>, but at this point, the supporting roles were beneficial more for the guest artists than they were for Lamar, whose artistic clout was unrivaled. He snagged five more Grammys: DAMN. won Best Rap Album; \"HUMBLE.\" took Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, and Best Video; and Best Rap/Sung Performance went to \"LOYALTY.,\" the <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a> collaboration. Another number one hit followed in February 2018. The soundtrack Black Panther: The Album featured Lamar on every track. Its three singles -- \"All the Stars\" (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7tYKF4w9nC0nq9CsPZTHyP\">SZA</a>), \"King's Dead\" (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:28ExwzUQsvgJooOI0X1mr3\">Jay Rock</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>), and \"Pray for Me\" (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a>) -- eventually hit the Top 40. That April, DAMN. won the Pulitzer Prize for Music. It was the first time the judges recognized a work outside the genres of classical and jazz. Months later, \"King's Dead\" made Lamar a 13-time Grammy winner when it took the award for Best Rap Performance. \"All the Stars\" alone was nominated in four categories, while Black Panther was up for Album of the Year. The film itself was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. \r\n\nAfter some time away from music that included an acting role in the fifth season of the Starz network series Power, Lamar resurfaced in August 2021 on cousin <a href=\"spotify:artist:5SXuuuRpukkTvsLuUknva1\">Baby Keem</a>'s \"Family Ties.\" The single, a highlight of The Melodic Blue, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5SXuuuRpukkTvsLuUknva1\">Keem</a>'s album debut for Lamar and Dave Free's new <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22pgLang%22\">pgLang</a> label, won Best Rap Performance at the following Grammys. Lamar then performed at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside hip-hop royalty that included <a href=\"spotify:artist:6DPYiyq5kWVQS4RGwxzPC7\">Dr. Dre</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR\">Eminem</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7hJcb9fa4alzcOq3EaNPoG\">Snoop Dogg</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1XkoF8ryArs86LZvFOkbyr\">Mary J. Blige</a>. \r\n\nIn May 2022, Lamar issued \"The Heart, Pt. 5\" as a ruminative prelude to his fifth full-length. An emotionally complex and raw double album, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers landed later that month and went straight to the top of the Billboard 200. In addition to <a href=\"spotify:artist:5SXuuuRpukkTvsLuUknva1\">Keem</a>, the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:2WoVwexZuODvclzULjPQtm\">Sampha</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:46SHBwWsqBkxI7EeeBEQG7\">Kodak Black</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:6Lt6KFXX3P0v6vfrynQAMo\">Beth Gibbons</a> made featured appearances. It was named Best Rap Album at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, where \"The Heart, Pt. 5\" took the awards for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance. Also in 2023, he was featured on <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m\">Beyoncé</a>'s single \"America Has a Problem.\"\r\n\nIn 2024, Lamar was part of a well-publicized feud with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">J. Cole</a>. After <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">Cole</a> had named the three as the \"big three\" greatest rappers in modern hip-hop, Lamar asserted that he was the only one during his guest verse on <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>'s song \"Like That,\" which topped the Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">Cole</a> then criticized Lamar on his song \"7 Minute Drill,\" which was met with a poor reception; <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">Cole</a> apologized for the song and removed it from streaming services. In April, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> released two diss tracks against Lamar, who responded with the vitriolic \"Euphoria\" and \"6:16 in L.A.\" After another exchange of diss tracks, Lamar again returned fire with \"Not Like Us,\" a collaboration with Mustard that broke single-day streaming records, topped the Hot 100, and earned Grammy nominations in five categories, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year. That November, with no advance notice, Lamar released his sixth album, GNX. Sounwave and <a href=\"spotify:artist:414TS3VqZf1XPCBixdmX9n\">Jack Antonoff</a> co-produced each track with variable assistance from the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:6HQYnRM4OzToCYPpVBInuU\">Kamasi Washington</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7MNEVabc4cs19CbzAFZmXz\">Terrace Martin</a>, and Mustard. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi",

With this new chapter, Gustafsson has returned to her roots, recalling the carefree, experimental mindset she inhabited when she first picked up producing, in addition to utilizing the boundless skills she’s gained since then. With this newest collection of ethereal, erratic, heavy-hitting, and hypnotic tracks, she creates sonic worlds with the intention of staying curious, eager, and above all, brave. In retaining her universal drive to push the boundaries of her production, her innovative and distinct style shines more than ever today.

Every release from the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania band has seen them exploring the sonic overlaps of hardcore, emo, and ‘90s alternative rock without an iota of self-consciousness, or pretension, creeping into the mix. The band’s latest is a collection of 11 songs that show One Step Closer reaching for something deeply honest and, as always, authentic. \n\nWith founding members Ryan Savitski (vocals) and Ross Thompson (guitar) at the helm of One Step Closer, alongside newest addition Colman O’Brien (guitar), the three were able to fearlessly guide One Step Closer in new directions. Taken in full, All You Embrace is the sound of One Step Closer honoring their past while building a future that looks more open, more creative, and more expansive than anything the band has done before.",

        "biography": "Benson Boone&#39;s intimate, diaristic pop songs are constantly evolving as he quickly becomes a global hitmaker. His latest single, the viral smash hit &#34;Beautiful Things,&#34; quickly soared into the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 after topping charts across the globe. In 2023, MTV named Boone their Global PUSH Artist for October, while his PULSE EP generated tens of millions of streams. After headlining a sold-out tour across North America and Europe, he ended the year with the release of his moving single “To Love Someone.” The PULSE EP was preceded by his 2022 piano ballad “Before You” and the Walk Me Home… EP, which included his breakout single “GHOST TOWN” — Boone&#39;s first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 and a Top 25 hit at both Top 40 and Hot AC radio. It also became his first RIAA-certified Gold record, followed by “In The Stars,” which is now certified Platinum. First discovered by Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds, Boone was quickly signed to Reynolds’ Night Street Records in partnership with Warner Records in 2021. He is reaching new heights in 2024, with over 2 billion career streams to date, an upcoming world tour, and a hotly anticipated debut album on the way.",

He stepped into the spotlight on the 2019 single &#34;<a href=\"spotify:track:4e8zIDjctZ1DtUPZTraGzS\" data-name=\"Middle of Somewhere\">Middle of Somewhere</a>.&#34; &#34;I wanted to do something totally new,” Jesse revealed. “We had a plan to do a music video for &#39;Middle of Somewhere,&#39; and I showed up in spandex and paint!

From the excitement of first love portrayed in WHO! to the pain of first breakup captured in WHY.., HOW? sheds light on the various situations and emotions that span in between. \n\nTheir newest EP 19.99, the title of the 3rd EP, is an imperfect number that symbolizes the moment right before turning 20, the most passionate time in life. The new album candidly explores the immature yet innocent thoughts and profound dilemmas of youth at the cusp of transitioning from their teens to twenties. Comprised of members who are either newly in their twenties or on the verge of turning 20, K-pop’s free spirits have actively participated in the album’s production, contributing to both composition and lyrics of six out of seven tracks, to capture the essence of the experiences of their youth. Their music is bound to resonate deeply with those navigating the ups and downs of transitioning to adulthood.",

Grammy winning pop superstar Bruno Mars even selected The Green to open his three sold out shows at Honolulu’s Blaisdell Arena in 2014 and his two sold out dates at Honolulu’s Aloha Stadium, Hawaii’s largest outdoor venue, in 2018. \n\nThe Green have also appeared on several of America’s biggest music festivals, including the Vans Warped Tour, Wakarusa, Life Is Beautiful, Sierra Nevada World Music Festival, One Love Cali Reggae Festival, California Roots Festival, Holo Holo Music Festival, Lake Tahoe Reggae Festival and Rebelution’s Bright Side Festival in Jamaica.\n\nFrom their first album release to their latest EP, Summertime, The Green’s musicality has always transcended fans to a place of sincerity, culture, and growth. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, The Green released Brand New Eyes, by performing two consecutive shows on May 20-21, 2021, at an event called Brand New Eyes: The Experience. It was held on the rooftop of Waikiki’s International Market Place and is Hawaii’s first rooftop concert.\n\nThey are currently gearing up for their Summertime Tour with special guests Natural Vibrations.",

        "biography": "Sometimes Mitski feels life would be easier without hope or a soul or love. But when she closes her eyes and thinks about what’s truly hers, what can’t be repossessed or demolished, she sees love. “The best thing I ever did in my life was to love people,” she says. “I wish I could leave behind all the love I have after I die, so I can shine all this goodness, all this love that I’ve created onto other people.” She hopes her newest album, The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We, will shine love long after she’s gone. That’s precisely how it feels: like a love that’s haunting the land.\n \n“This is my most American album,” she says. The music feels like a profound act of witnessing this country, in all its private sorrows and contradictions. Sonically Mitski’s most epic and wise album, it introduces wounds and then actively heals them. Here, love is time-traveling to bless our tender days, like light from a distant star.\n \nIt&#39;s full of the ache of the grown-up, seemingly mundane heartbreaks and joys that are often unsung but feel enormous. It’s a tiny epic. From the bottom of a glass, to a driveway slushy with memory and snow, to a freight train barreling through the Midwest, all the way to the moon, it feels like everything and everyone is crying out in pain, arching towards love. Love is that inhospitable land, beckoning and then rejecting us. To love this place, this earth, this America, this body takes work. It might be impossible. The best things are.\n\nWritten by Will Arbery",

    {
        "biography": "Houston-born rapper and producer Travis Scott's psychedelic trap style makes him one of the more distinctive talents to have risen to the height of mainstream commercial popularity. His heavily processed, half-sung/half-rapped style set him apart early on, and he grew from affiliations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>'s GOOD Music and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4OBJLual30L7gRl5UkeRcT\">T.I.</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Grand+Hustle%22\">Grand Hustle</a> in the early 2010s to chart-dominating popularity before the close of the decade. After his first studio album, 2015's Rodeo, debuted in the number three position, Scott followed with a pair of number one full-lengths, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016) and Astroworld (2018), all the while assisting on platinum singles headlined by the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a> (\"Bitch Better Have My Money\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:7tYKF4w9nC0nq9CsPZTHyP\">SZA</a> (\"Love Galore\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> (\"Portland\"), and working extensively with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0VRj0yCOv2FXJNP47XQnx5\">Quavo</a> as <a href=\"spotify:artist:6extd4B6hl8VTmnlhpl2bY\">Huncho Jack</a>. Whether leading or supporting, Scott's presence was unmistakable, and he quickly accumulated Grammys, endorsement deals, and appearances in more than 80 charting songs. By the 2020s, Scott was one of the most successful living artists on the planet. This level of fame played into both extreme success and profound tragedy, with Scott being at the center of controversy surrounding the deaths and injuries of hundreds of fans at his 2021 Astroworld festival before debuting his genre-crossing, Grammy-nominated fourth album, 2023's UTOPIA. He was then featured on a variety of tracks with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3a1tBryiczPAZpgoZN9Rzg\">Asake</a>, and others.\r\n\nBorn Jacques Webster, Travis Scott grew up in a suburb of Houston and began making music as a teenager. He formed a duo called the Graduates with Chris Holloway, and they released an EP in 2009. The following year, he formed another duo, the Classmates, with OG Chess. Scott produced the pair's two full-lengths, Buddy Rich and Cruis'n USA, but they broke up near the end of 2011. After dropping out of college, Scott moved to Los Angeles and began recording music on his own. He met <a href=\"spotify:artist:4OBJLual30L7gRl5UkeRcT\">T.I.</a> and eventually <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>. Scott was hired as an in-house producer for GOOD Music, and appeared on the label's Cruel Summer compilation in 2012. Scott's debut, Owl Pharaoh, was originally scheduled to be released as a free mixtape in 2012, but as his profile grew (including a placement in XXL Magazine's Freshman Class of 2013), and sample clearance issues, the album wasn't released until May 2013. Featuring guest appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:4OBJLual30L7gRl5UkeRcT\">T.I.</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:17lzZA2AlOHwCwFALHttmp\">2 Chainz</a> (on the single \"Upper Echelon\") as well as <a href=\"spotify:artist:6O4EGCCb6DoIiR6B1QCQgp\">Toro y Moi</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:13rHmjtJmlIJ2aDyJc7CLV\">Justin Vernon</a> of <a href=\"spotify:artist:4LEiUm1SRbFMgfqnQTwUbQ\">Bon Iver</a>, Owl Pharaoh eventually garnered a nomination for Best Mixtape at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards. \r\n\nThe buildup to Scott's first proper studio album involved the Days Before Rodeo mixtape, promoted with the singles \"Don't Play\" and \"Mamacita,\" and the March 2015 U.S. Rodeo Tour, headlined by Scott and supported by <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>. Several of the dates sold out. The same month, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a>'s Scott-produced hit single \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" was released. \"3500\" and \"Antidote\" were issued ahead of Rodeo, Scott's second full-length, which followed in September on <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Grand+Hustle%22\">Grand Hustle</a>/Epic and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200. Toward the end of the year, \"Antidote\" peaked at number 16 on the Hot 100 and became Scott's first platinum single. \r\n\nChatter regarding a follow-up, along with numerous delays, ensued throughout much of 2016. Meanwhile, Scott extended his commercial presence with featured spots on <a href=\"spotify:artist:137W8MRPWKqSmrBGDBFSop\">Wiz Khalifa</a>'s \"Bake Sale,\" <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a>'s \"Woo,\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>'s \"FML,\" as well as a collaboration with <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0VRj0yCOv2FXJNP47XQnx5\">Quavo</a>, \"Pick Up the Phone,\" a mid-year hit issued as the lead single of <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a>'s JEFFERY. Three months later, after \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" earned platinum certification, Scott's second proper album arrived. Titled Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight after one of <a href=\"spotify:artist:0VRj0yCOv2FXJNP47XQnx5\">Quavo</a>'s lines in \"Pick Up the Phone,\" the woozy, mostly midtempo set featured that hit and contributions from the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:74V3dE1a51skRkdII8y2C6\">André 3000</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0fA0VVWsXO9YnASrzqfmYu\">Kid Cudi</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>. It went straight to the top of the Billboard 200. \r\n\nLeading up to his third LP, Scott was featured on a slew of tracks, including platinum singles headlined by <a href=\"spotify:artist:7tYKF4w9nC0nq9CsPZTHyP\">SZA</a> (\"Love Galore\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> (\"Portland\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:360IAlyVv4PCEVjgyMZrxK\">Miguel</a> (\"Sky Walker\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:17lzZA2AlOHwCwFALHttmp\">2 Chainz</a> (\"4 AM\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6Xgp2XMz1fhVYe7i6yNAax\">Trippie Redd</a> (\"Dark Knight Dummo\"). Scott's own \"Butterfly Effect\" arrived during this torrent of hits in May 2017 and promptly went platinum as well. Seven months later, Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, a collaborative full-length with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0VRj0yCOv2FXJNP47XQnx5\">Quavo</a>, entered the Billboard 200 at number three. The following May, Scott released \"Watch,\" a non-album track featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4O15NlyKLIASxsJ0PrXPfz\">Lil Uzi Vert</a>, and within three months released Astroworld, which he considered the true follow-up to Rodeo. Featuring \"Butterfly Effect,\" the album -- named after a demolished Houston amusement park -- debuted at number one and was supported with a second single, \"Sicko Mode.\" Scott closed out 2018 by appearing on multiple tracks of <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>'s Not All Heroes Wear Capes album. \r\n\nAfter collaborating with <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6l3HvQ5sa6mXTsMTB19rO5\">J. Cole</a> on 2019's \"The London\" and being featured on <a href=\"spotify:artist:6eUKZXaKkcviH0Ku9w2n3V\">Ed Sheeran</a>'s \"Antisocial,\" Scott issued his own solo single, \"Highest in the Room.\" JackBoys, a brief compilation showcasing artists from Scott's <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Cactus+Jack+Records%22\">Cactus Jack Records</a> label, appeared at the end of the year. The release subsequently became the first number one album of the 2020s. Another <a href=\"spotify:artist:50co4Is1HCEo8bhOyUWKpn\">Young Thug</a> collaboration, \"Franchise,\" also featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QJIPDAEDILuo8AIq3pMuU\">M.I.A.</a>, debuted in September 2020 on top of the Billboard 200. \r\n\nIn January 2021, Spanish DJ <a href=\"spotify:artist:2o08sCWF5yyo2G4DCiT7T9\">HVME</a> released a deep house reworking of Scott and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s song \"Goosebumps,\" eventually topping Billboard's Hot Dance/Electronic Songs Chart. Two more tracks appeared that November, with both \"Escape Plan\" and \"Mafia\" arriving concurrently and hitting the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \r\n\nOn November 5, 2021, there was a fatal crowd crush during Scott's performance at his third annual Astroworld Festival in Houston, Texas. The event resulted in the death of 10 people with over 300 being treated for injuries. The rapper apologized and the rest of the festival was canceled. Scott and others involved in the festival were investigated, though a Texas grand jury ultimately declined to indict them. \r\n\nIn May 2022, Scott performed at the Billboard Music Awards, his first live appearance since the Astroworld Festival tragedy. He also contributed to four tracks on <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>'s Heroes & Villains album. In July 2023, he released his fourth studio album, UTOPIA. An ambitious, genre-crossing concept album in the vein of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x\">Kanye West</a>'s Yeezus, it featured a bevy of producers, including Scott, <a href=\"spotify:artist:53KwLdlmrlCelAZMaLVZqU\">James Blake</a>, WondaGurl, and others. Also featured were many guests, such as <a href=\"spotify:artist:4q3ewBCX7sLwd24euuV69X\">Bad Bunny</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a> on the lead single, \"K-pop,\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6vWDO969PvNqNYHIOW5v0m\">Beyoncé</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4LEiUm1SRbFMgfqnQTwUbQ\">Bon Iver</a> on \"Delresto (Echoes).\" UTOPIA topped both the Billboard 200 and R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. Scott's work throughout much of 2024 largely consisted of features on records by <a href=\"spotify:artist:1URnnhqYAYcrqrcwql10ft\">21 Savage</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iEtIxbK0KxaSlF7G42ZOp\">Metro Boomin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0YinUQ50QDB7ZxSCLyQ40k\">Mustard</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3a1tBryiczPAZpgoZN9Rzg\">Asake</a>. ~ Paul Simpson & Andy Kellman, Rovi",

        "biography": "With his melodic songs and inspirational lyrics Swedish house producer Avicii was one of the defining artists of modern pop. The genre-bending tracks captivated audiences worldwide and are widely considered the soundtrack of a generation.\nBorn 1989 in Stockholm, Tim Bergling grew up being obsessed with video games, a passion that in his teens translated into him making music. After being discovered through a blog and gaining some traction with ”Seek Bromance”, his career exploded in 2011 with ”Levels”. His way of boldly blending musical styles became a trademark of Avicii, shown on full display on his first album ”True”. The leading single ”Wake Me Up”, a fusion of house music and traditional bluegrass, reached the number one spot on the iTunes charts in over 60 countries. The song became the most streamed ever on Spotify to that date, played over 200 million times, and turned Avicii into a sought-after pop producer, collaborating with stars such as Madonna and Coldplay.\nAfter touring the world at a frantic pace, all the while struggling with health issues and substance abuse, in 2015 Tim Bergling retired from performing live altogether.   The slower lifestyle allowed him to focus purely on composing, drawing inspiration this time mainly from African and Asian traditions. Bergling was working on his fourth project, ”Tim”, when he tragically passed away during a holiday trip to Oman, in April of 2018. He is regarded as one of the most influential house producers of all time. ",

Infectiously melodic and energetic, their distinct sound has earned Dutch DJ/Producer duo Ruben den Boer and Victor Pool over 1 billion streams, multiple platinum and gold records, and a loyal global fanbase. \nVictor and Ruben found quick success after releasing their debut record “Harmony” in 2012; within a year they were on DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJ list and touring globally. Vicetone has since brought their brand of emotionally charged dance music to their 2021 album “Legacy” and hits like “Nevada” and “Astronomia”.\nVicetone’s latest EP “Departing Reality” showcases the duo’s talent for innovative production and experimentation while staying true to their roots. &#34;One thing that’s become apparent from working together for so long is that Victor is drawn toward happy songs, while I gravitate toward darker more melancholic songs&#34; explains Ruben. The EP’s 4 singles exemplify this dynamic tension and the duo’s ability to play in a broad emotional range, from the positive “Tomorrow Never Comes” to the dark “Voices in My Head”. In ‘World Has A Heartbeat’ Vicetone expands on their classic guitar-based sound, while in “Dopamine Junkie” the duo pays homage to the addictive melodies that hallmark their brand of dance music.\nInspired by the feeling of losing yourself in the perfect melody, “Departing Reality” exhibits the creativity and technical mastery Vicetone is known for.",

        "biography": "After shattering records with her chart-topping, 4x Platinum debut album SOUR – the fastest album in history to have all of its songs certified RIAA Platinum or higher – Olivia Rodrigo makes a monumental return with her new album GUTS, revealing newly heightened sophistication as a vocalist and lyricist. Produced by and co-written with Daniel Nigro (her main creative partner on SOUR), each song intensifies the emotional honesty that’s always imbued her storytelling. Rodrigo expands her expressive palette, uncovering entirely new dimensions of her artistry, as exemplified by lead single “vampire.” \n\nHailed by Pitchfork as the “Best New Track” upon release, “vampire” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 – as did SOUR hits “drivers license” and “good 4 u,” making Rodrigo the first artist ever to debut the lead singles from two career-opening albums atop the prestigious chart.  The 20-year-old is the youngest artist in Hot 100 history to debut three hits at No. 1. \n\nNamed the #1 Album of 2021 by Rolling Stone and hailed as one of the Best Albums of 2021 by The New York Times, among others, SOUR is now triple Platinum in the U.S. and has sold over 16.8 million global album adjusted units with over 66 billion streams worldwide. She received seven GRAMMY® Award nominations—including nods in each of the Big Four categories—and took home awards for Best New Artist, Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 64th GRAMMY® Awards.",

        "biography": "With over 5.5 billion cumulative streams (including 2 billion on “Dandelions”), Rolling Stone proclaiming that “She’s THE one to watch,” and millions upon millions of followers, views, and likes across all social platforms, Ruth B. is one of the most listened to artists worldwide. Recently she returned with a collaboration with viral music star Dean Lewis, releasing the hauntingly beautiful song “28”.\n\nAfter her debut song “Lost Boy,” which was an instant viral global chart-topping hit in 2015 that propelled her debut EP The Intro into a gold-certification, she released two more critically acclaimed full projects that earned her three Juno nominations, including Album of the Year and Artist of the Year. In 2022, Ruth B.’s beautiful composition “Paper Airplanes,” was used as the end title song for Tyler Perry’s feature film A Jazzman’s Blues. To follow it all up came “Jupiter Rising” from R&amp;B young superstar Rod Wave, who used Ruth’s recent song, “Paper Airplanes”, as the musical bed for his R&amp;B hit single. \n\nThis year brought more hits with “Always You”, the theme song from the major motion picture Maybe I Do, to the young singer Lyn Lapid’s hot new Republic Records track “Do You Really” composed by and featuring Ruth B. on vocals.\n\nBoth Ruth B. and Dean Lewis are members of the 4 billion streams club, and their collaboration on “28” is just a signal of more to come from Ruth B.",

        "biography": "Reggae's most transcendent and iconic figure, Bob Marley was the first Jamaican artist to achieve international superstardom, in the process introducing the music of his native island nation to the far-flung corners of the globe. Marley's music gave voice to the day-to-day struggles of the Jamaican experience, vividly capturing not only the plight of the country's impoverished and oppressed but also the devout spirituality that remains their source of strength. Backed by his all-star band <a href=\"spotify:artist:6uSKeCyQEhvPC2NODgiqFE\">the Wailers</a>, Marley delivered classics in the ska era of the early '60s, all but invented roots music with '70s albums like Catch a Fire, and offered millions of listeners an entry point to reggae with his posthumous best-of collection, 1984's Legend. His songs of faith, devotion, and revolution created a legacy that continues to live on not only through the music of his extended family but also through generations of artists around the world touched by his genius. \r\n\nRobert Nesta Marley was born February 6, 1945, in rural St. Ann's Parish, Jamaica; the son of a middle-aged white father and teenaged Black mother, he left home at 14 to pursue a music career in Kingston, becoming a pupil of local singer and devout Rastafarian <a href=\"spotify:artist:5XgHWn04awuFqBm0R5lLFX\">Joe Higgs</a>. He cut his first single, \"Judge Not,\" in 1962 for <a href=\"spotify:artist:7pfXISxo1nRPljiImq1BLp\">Leslie Kong</a>, severing ties with the famed producer soon after over a monetary dispute. In 1963 Marley teamed with fellow singers <a href=\"spotify:artist:0oea1hwGMfUxZbLxJc1XUN\">Peter Tosh</a>, Bunny Livingston, Junior Braithwaite, Beverly Kelso, and Cherry Smith to form the vocal group the Teenagers; later rechristened the Wailing Rudeboys and later simply <a href=\"spotify:artist:6uSKeCyQEhvPC2NODgiqFE\">the Wailers</a>, they signed on with producer Coxsone Dodd's legendary Studio One and recorded their debut, \"I'm Still Waiting.\" When Braithwaite and Smith exited <a href=\"spotify:artist:6uSKeCyQEhvPC2NODgiqFE\">the Wailers</a>, Marley assumed lead vocal duties, and in early 1964 the group's follow-up, \"Simmer Down,\" topped the Jamaican charts. A series of singles including \"Let Him Go (Rude Boy Get Gail),\" \"Dancing Shoes,\" \"Jerk in Time,\" \"Who Feels It Knows It,\" and \"What Am I to Do\" followed, and in all, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6uSKeCyQEhvPC2NODgiqFE\">the Wailers</a> recorded some 70 tracks for Dodd before disbanding in 1966. On February 10 of that year, Marley married <a href=\"spotify:artist:13Kn0OI9oXhBDXClb1hGy3\">Rita Anderson</a>, a singer in the group the Soulettes; she later enjoyed success as a member of the vocal trio the I-Threes. Marley then spent the better part of the year working in a factory in Newark, Delaware, his mother's home since 1963. \r\n\nUpon returning to Jamaica that October, Marley re-formed <a href=\"spotify:artist:6uSKeCyQEhvPC2NODgiqFE\">the Wailers</a> with Livingston and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0oea1hwGMfUxZbLxJc1XUN\">Tosh</a>, releasing \"Bend Down Low\" on their own short-lived Wail 'N' Soul 'M label; at this time all three members began devoting themselves to the teachings of the Rastafari faith, a cornerstone of Marley's life and music until his death. Beginning in 1968, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6uSKeCyQEhvPC2NODgiqFE\">the Wailers</a> recorded a wealth of new material for producer Danny Sims before teaming the following year with producer <a href=\"spotify:artist:1TsG4AumsMt1Tcq2nHpov9\">Lee \"Scratch\" Perry</a>; backed by <a href=\"spotify:artist:1TsG4AumsMt1Tcq2nHpov9\">Perry</a>'s house band, <a href=\"spotify:artist:12CNljuN6DW9e5x61FS03b\">the Upsetters</a>, the trio cut a number of classics, including \"My Cup,\" \"Duppy Conqueror,\" \"Soul Almighty,\" and \"Small Axe,\" which fused powerful vocals, ingenious rhythms, and visionary production to lay the groundwork for much of the Jamaican music in their wake. <a href=\"spotify:artist:12CNljuN6DW9e5x61FS03b\">Upsetters</a> bassist <a href=\"spotify:artist:5sroD1hthJxqlcgjWTJRuV\">Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett</a> and his drummer brother Carlton soon joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:6uSKeCyQEhvPC2NODgiqFE\">the Wailers</a> full-time, and in 1971 the group founded another independent label, <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Tuff+Gong%22\">Tuff Gong</a>, releasing a handful of singles before signing to Chris Blackwell's <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Island+Records%22\">Island Records</a> a year later.\r\n\nCatch a Fire, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6uSKeCyQEhvPC2NODgiqFE\">the Wailers</a>' <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Island%22\">Island</a> debut released in 1973, was the first of their albums released outside of Jamaica, and immediately earned worldwide acclaim; the follow-up, Burnin', launched the track \"I Shot the Sheriff,\" a Top Ten hit for <a href=\"spotify:artist:6PAt558ZEZl0DmdXlnjMgD\">Eric Clapton</a> in 1974. With <a href=\"spotify:artist:6uSKeCyQEhvPC2NODgiqFE\">the Wailers</a> poised for stardom, however, both Livingston and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0oea1hwGMfUxZbLxJc1XUN\">Tosh</a> quit the group to pursue solo careers; Marley then brought in the I-Threes, which in addition to <a href=\"spotify:artist:13Kn0OI9oXhBDXClb1hGy3\">Rita Marley</a> consisted of singers <a href=\"spotify:artist:4qLV9FR6ZVLS6W8drD78hM\">Marcia Griffiths</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:22UW0iI6edH6oE38DRBcsQ\">Judy Mowatt</a>. The new lineup proceeded to tour the world prior to releasing their 1975 breakthrough album, Natty Dread, scoring their first U.K. Top 40 hit with the classic \"No Woman, No Cry.\" Sold-out shows at the London Lyceum, where Marley played to racially mixed crowds, yielded the superb Live! later that year, and with the success of 1976's Rastaman Vibration, which hit the Top Ten in the U.S., it became increasingly clear that his music had carved its own niche within the pop mainstream.\r\n\nAs great as Marley's fame had grown outside of Jamaica, at home he was viewed as a figure of almost mystical proportions, a poet and prophet whose every word had the nation's collective ear. His power was perceived as a threat in some quarters, and on December 3, 1976, he was wounded in an assassination attempt; the ordeal forced him to leave Jamaica for over a year. Released in 1977, Exodus was his biggest record to date, generating the hits \"Jamming,\" \"Waiting in Vain,\" and \"One Love/People Get Ready\"; Kaya was another smash, highlighted by the gorgeous \"Is This Love\" and \"Satisfy My Soul.\" Another classic live date, Babylon by Bus, preceded the release of 1979's Survival. Kicked off by a concert in the newly liberated Zimbabwe, 1980 loomed as Marley's biggest year yet; a tour of the U.S. was announced, but he collapsed while jogging in New York's Central Park, and it was discovered he suffered from cancer that had spread to his brain, lungs, and liver. Uprising was the final album released in Marley's lifetime -- he died May 11, 1981, at age 36.\r\n\nPosthumous efforts including 1983's Confrontation, the best-selling 1984 retrospective Legend, and the 2012 documentary Marley kept the man's music alive. In the wake of her husband's passing, <a href=\"spotify:artist:13Kn0OI9oXhBDXClb1hGy3\">Rita Marley</a> scored a solo hit with \"One Draw,\" but despite the subsequent success of singles \"Many Are Called\" and \"Play Play,\" she had largely withdrawn from performing by the mid-'80s to focus on raising her children. Oldest son <a href=\"spotify:artist:0o0rlxlC3ApLWsxFkUjMXc\">David</a>, better known as <a href=\"spotify:artist:0o0rlxlC3ApLWsxFkUjMXc\">Ziggy</a>, went on to score considerable pop success as the leader of <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Z2jmNAP2UaGa8lPpi54wD\">the Melody Makers</a>, a Marley family group comprising siblings Cedella, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0CIwCGmQMqHqiblnZlFia1\">Stephen</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:081UsY9atZJbUyBYEHadxh\">Sharon</a>; their 1988 single \"Tomorrow People\" was a Top 40 U.S. hit, a feat even Bob himself never accomplished. <a href=\"spotify:artist:3QJzdZJYIAcoET1GcfpNGi\">Damian Marley</a>, Bob's youngest son, embraced a musical style that integrated reggae, R&B, and hip-hop, and in 2005 he scored a major hit with the single \"Welcome to Jamrock.\" <a href=\"spotify:artist:3QJzdZJYIAcoET1GcfpNGi\">Damian</a> has also collaborated with the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:4iHNK0tOyZPYnBU7nGAgpQ\">Mariah Carey</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0du5cEVh5yTK9QJze8zA0C\">Bruno Mars</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Isy6kedDrgPYoTS1dazA9\">Sean Paul</a>. <a href=\"spotify:artist:1XTGADISSMRf8B4TcVGYUC\">Ky-Mani Marley</a>, whose music also fuses elements of reggae and hip-hop, made his international breakthrough with the 2000 album The Journey and the single \"Gotta Be Movin' on Up,\" a collaboration with the conscious hip-hop duo <a href=\"spotify:artist:5DgjOwTN6o76J5Gf8MzEoL\">P.M. Dawn</a>. And <a href=\"spotify:artist:3QJzdZJYIAcoET1GcfpNGi\">Damian</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0o0rlxlC3ApLWsxFkUjMXc\">Ziggy</a>'s half-brother <a href=\"spotify:artist:7a4td2FhkuH58dApiBvnrv\">Julian Marley</a> (he grew up in England with his mother, Lucy Pounder) released his debut album, Lion in the Morning, in 1996, going on to earn a Grammy nomination for 2009's Awake. \r\n\nMarley himself remained synonymous with reggae's worldwide popularity long after his death, and the wealth of music he left behind was repackaged, remixed, re-examined, and re-released regularly throughout the decades in the form of both legitimate projects and a never-ending string of bootleg releases. Apart from the obvious impact of Legend (which was certified platinum more than 15 times over and holds the distinction of best-selling reggae album of all time,) other releases of note issued after Marley's death include 1999's Chant Down Babylon, a hip-hop reworking of Marley classics that boasted contributions from <a href=\"spotify:artist:78xUyw6FkVZrRAtziFdtdu\">the Roots</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2Mu5NfyYm8n5iTomuKAEHl\">Lauryn Hill</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PyWEKLWI0vHPmoNrIX0QE\">Rakim</a>, and others and 2009's B Is for Bob, which reimagines selections from his catalog as children's songs. In 2023, <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Island+Records%22\">Island Records</a> produced and released Africa Unite. Titled after the sixth track on Marley’s 1979 Survival album, it offered a roster of contemporary Afrobeat artists including <a href=\"spotify:artist:1hNaHKp2Za5YdOAG0WnRbc\">Tiwa Savage</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:01DTVE3KmoPogPZaOvMqO8\">Sarkodie</a>, Utty O, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2zFOy7V1b9u32uHLQ9fGni\">Winky</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7oMRcCu0OYSCtCyS3P37iC\">Afro B</a>, , and <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hKQc001G7ggs3ZyxMdkGq\">Patoranking</a> -- all adding their voices and rhythms to the <a href=\"spotify:artist:6uSKeCyQEhvPC2NODgiqFE\">Wailers</a>' enduring songs. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi",

The singer and songwriter left home at 17 to pursue his calling as a musical artist. Caesar independently released his first two EPs, Praise Break (2014) and Pilgrim’s Paradise (2017), to widespread praise—the first of which landed at #19 on Rolling Stone’s list of “20 Best R&amp;B Albums of 2014.” However, it was his 2017 debut album, Freudian, that marked him as one of this generation’s most exciting artists to watch—the album went on to be nominated for two GRAMMY Awards (“Best R&amp;B Album” and “Best R&amp;B Performance” for “Get You”), and the following year, Caesar took home the award for “Best R&amp;B Performance” for his breakout hit, “Best Part.” The GRAMMY Award-winning and Juno Award-winning artist soon followed this early success with his critically acclaimed sophomore album, Case Study 01 (2019), and most recently his multi-platinum, worldwide hit, “Peaches” with Justin Bieber and Giveon (2021). Amassing over 5 billion streams across his catalogue and over 31 million monthly listeners, Caesar currently ranked the 79th “Most Listened To Artist in the World” and top 10 “Most Streamed Canadian Artists of All Time” on Spotify. Now, Daniel Caesar gears up for his next chapter, as he continues to redefine what R&amp;B can be, while quietly overtaking the mainstream.",

For over a decade he has worked as a composer for theatre, concert and film alongside developing his own artist projects. Simultaneously, he’s continued to hone his craft through studies and in 2020 he graduated with a PhD from The Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. Eriksson has always been fascinated by the limitless possibilities inherent to music and drawn to the challenge of mastering different genres. The River Foxcroft project started with his newfound love for the Dobro guitar. He took lessons from the great Mike Witcher and the tunes started to evolve in tandem with learning the instrument. With a mix of folk and americana he carries the listener through misty mountains passes and desolate countrysides.",

        "biography": "First gaining renown as the voice of <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a>, Beth Gibbons is an enigmatic yet intensely emotional musician. <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a>'s innovative version of trip-hop drew on the vocal jazz and pop of the past while reinventing it radically, and Gibbons' vocals -- which recalled bygone greats such as <a href=\"spotify:artist:7G1GBhoKtEPnP86X2PvEYO\">Nina Simone</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1WPcVNert9hn7mHsPKDn7j\">Edith Piaf</a> -- fit the group's postmodern mystique perfectly. As a solo artist, Gibbons places her elegant-yet-gritty contralto in a wide array of settings: The haunted chamber folk of 2002's <a href=\"spotify:artist:62NNHMoDbLSbR3THDaFNO7\">Rustin Man</a> collaboration Out of Season was a departure that nevertheless felt true to her artistry, as did her 2014 performance of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5PIshNx38qyLggwpqRhRRI\">Henryk Górecki</a>’s Symphony No. 3 \"Symphony of Sorrowful Songs\" with the Polish National Radio Symphony and the unflinching meditations on mortality of 2024's Lives Outgrown. In between these releases, she scored films and worked with French pop legend <a href=\"spotify:artist:4XYH5Be5pn1qkxhfaID3J5\">Jane Birkin</a>, stoner rock band <a href=\"spotify:artist:4167ji2eAk6k9gfVXclNp9\">Gonga</a>, and acclaimed rapper <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a> -- projects with little in common other than Gibbons' unerring ability to connect with the emotional truth of any kind of music.\r\n\nBorn into a farm family in Exeter, Devon, England in 1965, Gibbons embraced rural life fully as a girl and young woman, forgoing college to continue doing farm work and listening to music on a home stereo with her family. When she was 22, she moved to Bristol to become a singer, but didn't have much luck supporting herself until she met her future <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a> partner <a href=\"spotify:artist:53b2a4ytPlelgBJYLLocWh\">Geoff Barrow</a> while waiting to get on the dole. Prior to their meeting, <a href=\"spotify:artist:53b2a4ytPlelgBJYLLocWh\">Barrow</a> was a studio hand at Bristol's Coach House, where he worked with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3wury2nd8idV4GecUg5xze\">Primal Scream</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:762310PdDnwsDxAQxzQkfX\">Depeche Mode</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6FXMGgJwohJLUSr5nVlf9X\">Massive Attack</a>. Gibbons and <a href=\"spotify:artist:53b2a4ytPlelgBJYLLocWh\">Barrow</a> began working on a trip-hop project of their own, and with the addition of the local jazz guitarist <a href=\"spotify:artist:6jDiXQFNb5UYscCSghzEEA\">Adrian Utley</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a> were born. The trio's 1994 debut album Dummy was a massive success: it went platinum in four countries and gold in three others, it won the Mercury Prize for Best British Album in 1995, and the album and its single \"Sour Times\" were alternative rock hits in the U.S. \r\n\nDuring this time, Gibbons also worked with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3ruQgLVOS9GcDoqxTmksmr\">.O.Rang</a>, the project of former <a href=\"spotify:artist:7Fo8TAyGJr4VmhE68QamMf\">Talk Talk</a> members Paul Webb and Lee Harris (she had auditioned to be the group's lead singer, but became too busy with <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a> to pursue the opportunity). She appeared on their 1994 debut album Herd of Instinct and its follow-up, 1996's Fields and Waves. <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a> returned in 1997 with their darker, more experimental self-titled second album, which was also received warmly, going platinum in the U.K. and New Zealand and gold in four other countries. The trio followed it late in 1998 with Roseland NYC Live. \r\n\nAfter <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a> went on hiatus in 1999, Gibbons reunited with Webb, whose largely acoustic project <a href=\"spotify:artist:62NNHMoDbLSbR3THDaFNO7\">Rustin Man</a> lent a thoughtful feel to their acclaimed collaboration Out of Season. Upon its release in October 2002, the album reached number 28 on the U.K. Albums Chart. She then spent the next few years working with artists in different capacities: In 2004, songs she wrote appeared on <a href=\"spotify:artist:5P4UV7tMpOVbX4Hn1zDdJ4\">Fried</a>'s self-titled debut album and on <a href=\"spotify:artist:7bvcQXJHkFiN1ppIN3q4fi\">Joss Stone</a>'s Mind Body & Soul, while she lent her vocals to <a href=\"spotify:artist:1HY3qhAqbGC5jM7lfbSqft\">Rodrigo Leão</a>'s Cinema and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4XYH5Be5pn1qkxhfaID3J5\">Jane Birkin</a>'s Rendez-Vous.\r\n\nIn 2005, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a> reconvened to perform their first live dates in seven years and record material for their next album. The trio contributed a version of <a href=\"spotify:artist:01C9OoXDvCKkGcf735Tcfo\">Serge Gainsbourg</a>'s \"Requiem for Anna\" on the 2006 tribute album Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited. Meanwhile, Gibbons continued to work on other projects, including the score for the Diane Bertrand film L'Annulaire and appearances on <a href=\"spotify:artist:4XYH5Be5pn1qkxhfaID3J5\">Birkin</a>'s 2006 effort Fictions and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5MspMQqdVbdwP6ax3GXqum\">Annie Lennox</a>'s 2007 album Songs of Mass Destruction. The following year, Gibbons scored Bertrand's film Baby Blues and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a> released the acclaimed Third, which was certified gold in the U.K. and appeared in the Top Ten of 19 countries. \r\n\nIn the 2010s, Gibbons' projects became even more wide-ranging. She lent her vocals to \"Prospera's Coda,\" the final song on the soundtrack to Julie Taymor's 2010 adaptation of The Tempest; two years later, she appeared on <a href=\"spotify:artist:5BxMS9rhKHbSagaYFBICun\">JJ Doom</a>'s album Key to the Kuffs and was a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards. When <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a> performed in Kraków, Poland in 2013, Gibbons was invited to perform composer <a href=\"spotify:artist:5PIshNx38qyLggwpqRhRRI\">Henryk Górecki</a>’s Symphony No. 3 \"Symphony of Sorrowful Songs\" in Polish as part of a concert that also featured <a href=\"spotify:artist:4Z8W4fKeB5YxbusRsdQVPb\">Radiohead</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:0z9s3P5vCzKcUBSxgBDyLU\">Jonny Greenwood</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2cCUtGK9sDU2EoElnk0GNB\">the National</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:5HHKeO04SOcxUxjruFXf5l\">Bryce Dessner</a> and the Polish National Radio Symphony as conducted by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0qEO82Hj3SvjoNyEfKpRku\">Krysztof Penderecki</a>. To prepare for the November 2014 performance, Gibbons worked with vocal coaches on her Polish pronunciation and to extend her contralto voice into the soprano range necessary for the piece. That year, she also worked with the stoner rock band <a href=\"spotify:artist:4167ji2eAk6k9gfVXclNp9\">Gonga</a> on a cover of \"Black Sabbath.\" In 2018 she contributed to Clarion Calls, an audio installation that appeared at Ipswich's Spill festival and also included the voice of the <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Wabl1lPdNOeIn0SQ5A1mp\">Cocteau Twins</a>' <a href=\"spotify:artist:791Z3924aa619hZ3xsOJEx\">Elizabeth Fraser</a> among its 100 female vocalists. <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Domino+Records%22\">Domino Records</a> released Gibbons' performance of <a href=\"spotify:artist:5PIshNx38qyLggwpqRhRRI\">Górecki</a>’s Symphony No. 3 \"Symphony of Sorrowful Songs\" in March 2019. The album reached number five on the U.K. Independent Albums Chart. \r\n\nGibbons resurfaced in 2022, appearing on \"Mother I Sober\" from <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers and sharing an Album of the Year Grammy Award nomination as a featured artist and songwriter. That year, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6liAMWkVf5LH7YR9yfFy1Y\">Portishead</a> played live for the first time in seven years at a War Child benefit to support the people of Ukraine. In 2023, the group released a remastered, expanded edition of Roseland NYC Live. The following May, Gibbons issued the solo album Lives Outgrown on <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Domino%22\">Domino</a>. Over a decade in the making, it touched on midlife issues -- motherhood, menopause, and mortality among them -- with a sophisticated yet restless mix of acoustic, electronic, and orchestral sounds. ~ Heather Phares & Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi",

        "biography": "Hailing from upstate New York, surely one of the more unlikely locales for an authentic reggae act, 10 Ft.

Known for live shows that incorporate a loose, improvisatory jam band feel, the group garnered some renown in the Northeast U.S. live music circuit throughout the 2000s. 10 Ft. Ganja Plant debuted in 2000 with the independently released Presents, a more dub-flavored, instrumental affair than anything released by their parent group. ROIR, no stranger to classic dub and reggae, signed the band in 2001, releasing their follow-up, Hillside Airstrip. The group soldiered on with three more releases for ROIR -- Midnight Landing (2003), Bass Chalice (2005), and Bushrock (2009) -- that revealed influences and echoes of &#39;70s roots, from the close vocal harmonies of <a href=\"spotify:artist:0ESPEmxgaaAKGI39Jt0NlZ\" data-name=\"The Meditations\">The Meditations</a> to the dark, bass-heavy productions of Black Ark-era <a href=\"spotify:artist:1TsG4AumsMt1Tcq2nHpov9\" data-name=\"Lee \"Scratch\" Perry\">Lee \"Scratch\" Perry</a>. ~ Dave Shim, Rovi",

        "biography": "It’s been four years since Windang’s favourite sons released their last album – ARIA #2 ‘Brain Candy’ in 2020. It turned out to be their biggest album yet and set them on a path of constant touring, not only in Australia, but across the world, having just returned from yet another jaunt in US/CA with 21 headline shows in March this year.\n\nNow comes the exciting news of album #4, ‘Rebuild Repeat’, releasing June 14, 2024. It’s a body of work which sees guitarist and lead vocalist Zach Stephenson and drummer Billy Fleming stretching themselves creatively and embracing new sounds which take the band into an invigorating new direction. \n\nNew single ‘Base Camp’ is case in point. The song, about the journey life takes and the challenges of taking those first steps of change to achieve certain milestones, was worked on with Alex Burnett (Thelma Plum, Sparkadia) and Oli Horton (Foals, Alice Ivy) who co-wrote, produced and mixed the song alongside Tim McArtney (Gang of Youths, Jarryd James). The result is a feel good melodic pop song which still sounds quintessentially Hockey Dad.\n\n‘Still Have Room’ was first taste of ‘Rebuild Repeat’ for fans which they embraced, voting the song in at #45 in triple j’s annual Hottest 100 countdown of 2023; their 8th countdown entry.\n\nTo celebrate the release of ‘Rebuild Repeat’, Hockey Dad will be performing their biggest shows to date across Australia, kicking off in Perth on June 21 and ending in Sydney&#39;s iconic Horden Pavilion on July 6.",

        "biography": "Yumi Matsutoya (formerly <a href=\"spotify:artist:5W7F9IM2vsR9EDCk5T2Uqz\">Yumi Arai</a>) became one of the most famous members of Japan's singer/songwriter era in the 1970s, and continued to garner hits into the 2000s, a notable feat if one considers the careers of her Western contemporaries: <a href=\"spotify:artist:4FtSnMlCVxCswABUmdhwpm\">Carly Simon</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5hW4L92KnC6dX9t7tYM4Ve\">Joni Mitchell</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6QDWC6QeGhvCWCv3nUJwoV\">Laura Nyro</a>, and so on. Her voice is instantly recognizable: rough and smooth at the same time, bitter and sweet, slightly nasal, but deeper and lower than most Japanese female singers (it has become more so over time). She never fit the model of the cute, perky pop singer, but her fans are legion, allowing her to tour with a new album almost every year since she hit the big time in 1980. Her fans know her by her nickname, \"Yuming.\" \r\n\nBorn in Tokyo in 1954, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5W7F9IM2vsR9EDCk5T2Uqz\">Arai</a> made her debut in 1973 with the album Hikokigumo. Her first single barely cracked the Top 40, but then again neither had the debut singles of her contemporaries; it wasn't about that at the time. Unlike a more folk- or guitar-based sound of the West, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5W7F9IM2vsR9EDCk5T2Uqz\">Yumi Arai</a>'s music was closer to the jazz-rock of <a href=\"spotify:artist:3iDD7bnsjL9J4fO298r0L0\">Chicago</a> or <a href=\"spotify:artist:6P7H3ai06vU1sGvdpBwDmE\">Steely Dan</a> without the cynical edge. Three years later, things began to click. Her single \"Anohi Ni Kaeritai\" made the Top Ten; the accompanying album Yuming Brand was a success; and to top it off <a href=\"spotify:artist:5W7F9IM2vsR9EDCk5T2Uqz\">Arai</a> married the arranger of the music from that album, Masataka Matsutoya, changing her name. (Her husband continues to be her arranger to this day). From 1985 to the late '90s, she was more often in the Top Ten charts than out of it. Her tours sold out, known for their elaborate costumes and stage shows, and her records continued to sell in the millions. Matsutoya has influenced many female singers who have come after, showing that one can be successful and have artistic control without sacrificing anything. ~ Ted Mills, Rovi",

        "biography": "Born and raised in L.A., Doja Cat made her first upload to Soundcloud in 2013 at just 16-years-old. She developed a knack for music by studying piano and dance as a kid and listening to the likes of Busta Rhymes, Erykah Badu, Nicki Minaj, Drake, and more. Soon, she went from obsessing over Catwoman (the Halle Berry version) to “crate digging” on YouTube. \n \nSigned to Kemosabe/RCA during 2014, she unveiled her acclaimed Purrr! EP. Its lead single “So High” impressively racked up over 30 million cumulative streams and garnered praise from tastemakers such as Fader, Vibe, Paper, Pigeons &amp; Planes, and more. \n\nCooking up vibrantly, candy-coated beats, dropping bars doubled-up on double entendre, and singing with claws out, Amala unlocks a sweetly sexy world soundtracked by wild hip-hop, twisted pop, and smoked-out R&amp;B. Asserting a feline-esque dominance and a style that can only be described as every color in a box of crayons, Doja Cat’s unapologetic charisma, charm, and confidence immediately take center stage. \n \nIn August 2018, she released what would become her viral hit “Mooo!” which enjoyed over 10 million views on YouTube and Twitter in just a couple of days and was met with critical acclaim. In March 2019, she released the Amala Deluxe album which included her brand new song “Juicy.” \n \nWith the releases of <a href=\"spotify:album:1MmVkhiwTH0BkNOU3nw5d3\" data-name=\"Hot Pink\">Hot Pink</a>, <a href=\"spotify:album:1nAQbHeOWTfQzbOoFrvndW\" data-name=\"Planet Her\">Planet Her</a>, <a href=\"spotify:album:6DmPNcfpkXBVRJsEIJY9tl\" data-name=\"Scarlet\">Scarlet</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:album:2IUoE0jqkViW6gGfqLcjG2\" data-name=\"Scarlet 2 CLAUDE\">Scarlet 2 CLAUDE</a>, Doja’s ability to create hit records that are uniquely her own are what will continue to make her a standout act.",

        "biography": "15歳の頃、歌唱による喉の酷使が原因で突如声が出なくなるアクシデントに見舞われるも、数年後には独特のハスキーで甘い歌声を得ることとなる。2011年にシングル「六等星の夜」でメジャーデビュー。\n代表曲「蝶々結び」などを収録した4thアルバム「daydream」を2016年9月にリリースし、iTunesアルバムチャート1位などを獲得した他、CDショップ大賞2017において準大賞も受賞。2019年には16枚目のシングル「I beg you  / 花びらたちのマーチ / Sailing」をリリースし、自身初のオリコン週間シングルランキング初登場1位を記録する。\n\nAt the age of 15, Aimer suddenly lost her voice due to overuse of her throat by singing, but a few years later she got a unique husky and sweet singing voice. In 2011, she made her major debut with single &#34;<a href=\"spotify:track:57hbqDXNpE9rMmYd2U9dUB\" data-name=\"六等星の夜\">六等星の夜</a> (Rokutosei no yoru)&#34;.\nIn September 2016, she released her 4th album &#34;<a href=\"spotify:album:0gTeVkaC6wyVZEXNQUA4gF\" data-name=\"daydream\">daydream</a>&#34; which includes her representative song &#34;Chouchou Musubi&#34;, and placed #1 on the iTunes album chart. In 2019, she released her 16th single &#34;<a href=\"spotify:album:2YLBHyegPO32zvOWFJzkLN\" data-name=\"I beg you / 花びらたちのマーチ / Sailing\">I beg you / 花びらたちのマーチ / Sailing</a>&#34; which ranked #1 in the weekly single Oricon chart for the first time in her career.  Her song ‘Zankyosanka’ for the worldwide popular anime “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba” as its season 2 opening theme became a global hit soon after release in 2021. She is coming out with mini album titled “Deep down” to celebrate her 10th anniversary since debut, and the album will include CHAINSAW MAN ending theme ‘Deep down’.",

        "biography": "Death Lens want to be in your ear at all times. They hide their ferocity underneath a thick veneer of style until the energy and chaos of one of their live shows leaves every audience member disarmed and forever changed. Off the strength of 2022’s No Luck, tours with Militarie Gun and Together Pangea, and the support of their hometown, Death Lens is releasing their new album, Cold World, May 3rd on Epitaph Records. \n\nFor Death Lens, it’s all been building to this. Cold World is a departure from the early styles Death Lens mimicked as a young band, transmuting them into matured and brawny post-hardcore tinged rock songs. \n\nOn record, Death Lens have an established habit of writing hard-nosed rock that combines West Coast reverbed-out surf punk with tight and bouncy Britrock, deceptively characterizing the band as exclusively chill and vibe-focused when live, a Death Lens show has all the energy of hardcore. Slick guitar sonics and sugary backing vocal harmonies that feel like the best parts of indie punk and shoegaze are the foundation of their style, but in a 200 capacity room, Death Lens brings the same winning concoction as Turnstile and Militarie Gun. In other words, these are the kinds of songs that become the soundtrack to enduring memories of nights of drunken, sweat-drenched singalongs.",

        "biography": "John Denver earned international acclaim as a songwriter, performer, actor, environmentalist and humanitarian. His career spanned four decades and his music has outlasted countless musical trends, earning numerous awards and honors. Fans responded to heartfelt urgings about ecology, peace and compassion that were consistently delivered in a gentle manner on his records and at live performances.\n\nUrged to change his name, young Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr. took his stage name from the capital of his favorite state. Later in life Denver and his family settled in Aspen, and his love for the Rocky Mountains inspired many of his songs.\n\nDenver experienced his first break when he was chosen from 250 hopefuls for the popular Mitchell Trio. He gained recognition when Peter, Paul &amp; Mary recorded his song “Leaving On A Jet Plane,” their first and only #1 hit. As the Mitchell Trio disbanded, Denver climbed the pop charts as a solo act with songs like “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” “Rocky Mountain High,” “Sunshine On My Shoulders,” “Annie’s Song,” “Back Home Again,” “Thank God I’m A Country Boy,” and “Calypso,” solidifying his position as a top star of the ‘70s.\n\nJohn Denver died tragically in a plane crash on October 12, 1997. Today millions of fans enjoy the work of this extraordinary performer, and the music is as relevant as ever. His humanitarian work continues to strengthen our global village, and his dynamic celebration of life, spirit and nature is a powerful inspiration to all",

        "biography": "One of the top boy bands of its era, *NSYNC helped to define the sound of danceable, R&B-influenced Y2K pop and launched the career of singers and former Mickey Mouse Club stars <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Justin Timberlake</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3p3U04w2DaiBzuYMZnYr00\">JC Chasez</a>. Working closely with producers like <a href=\"spotify:artist:1rjeVTt9Ra1ldvN7SpeK0G\">Max Martin</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:28imn3YWSbanafF6glFoyx\">Denniz Pop</a>, *NSYNC enjoyed almost immediate success, hitting the Top Five in the United States and Europe with their eponymous debut and spawning the hits \"I Want You Back\" and \"Tearin' Up My Heart.\" 2000's No Strings Attached and 2001's Celebrity fared even better, both topping the Billboard 200. Soon after that release, however, they disbanded. While the group did reunite for a performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, the individual members of *NSYNC had all gone on to pursue their own varied opportunities, with <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Timberlake</a> emerging as the biggest star, enjoying a highly successful, Grammy-winning music and acting career. A decade passed before the group reunited once again at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards, launching a comeback with the newly recorded single \"Better Place.\"\r\n\nAlthough *NSYNC emerged in 1995 in Orlando, Florida, singers <a href=\"spotify:artist:3p3U04w2DaiBzuYMZnYr00\">JC Chasez</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Justin Timberlake</a> had previously co-starred on The Mickey Mouse Club before relocating to Nashville, where they worked on solo projects with the same vocal coach and songwriters. <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Timberlake</a> soon returned to Orlando, where he befriended Chris Kirkpatrick and Joey Fatone. Along with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3p3U04w2DaiBzuYMZnYr00\">Chasez</a>, the four agreed to form a boy band, and *NSYNC officially launched after the addition of bass singer <a href=\"spotify:artist:77rp6J3oOIV6J68tFgVU7Q\">Lance Bass</a>. The group recorded its eponymous debut LP with help from a series of producers, including <a href=\"spotify:artist:28imn3YWSbanafF6glFoyx\">Denniz Pop</a> (whose protégé, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1rjeVTt9Ra1ldvN7SpeK0G\">Max Martin</a>, would later work with the band after <a href=\"spotify:artist:28imn3YWSbanafF6glFoyx\">Pop</a>'s death in 1998). The album was initially released by <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22BMG+Ariola+Munich%22\">BMG Ariola Munich</a>, and *NSYNC became an overnight success throughout much of Europe, where the singles \"I Want You Back\" and \"Tearing Up My Heart\" were sizable hits. The album was then released in America during the spring of 1998. Accompanied by a tour of the nation's roller rinks, it became immensely popular and eventually sold more than ten million copies, thus establishing the singers as teen pop titans. Home for Christmas followed later that same year and went double-platinum, while a similar version was released in Europe under the title The Winter Album.\r\n\nAlthough already celebrated as one of pop music's biggest acts, *NSYNC rose to greater heights with the release of No Strings Attached in 2000. The album was originally slated to appear in 1999, but a series of legal battles with former manager Lou Pearlman delayed its arrival by several months. After successfully escaping from Pearlman's contract and signing with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Jive+Entertainment%22\">Jive Entertainment</a>, *NSYNC happily watched as sales of No Strings Attached topped one million during its first day of release. Nearly two-and-a-half million copies were sold by the end of the week, and three singles soon cracked the Top Five in America: \"Bye Bye Bye\" (which many viewed as a sendoff to the band's old management), \"It's Gonna Be Me,\" and the ballad \"This I Promise You.\" Supported by a 76-date American tour that grossed over $75 million, No Strings Attached proved to be the most popular album of 2000, selling nearly ten million copies.\r\n\n*NSYNC returned to the road in early 2001, this time to promote the impending release of Celebrity. The album appeared that summer to continued fanfare, with first-week sales reaching nearly two million -- a feat that made Celebrity the second fastest-selling album of all time, bested only by No Strings Attached. The album featured a stronger debt to hip-hop and electronic dance genres, with production provided by the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:64MoFdq8ORI3V98AR5SPWL\">BT</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4Q9g9l3NqzvllaYFTmSYYv\">Darkchild</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0KuF7reCTOZwV7YJnHQqgr\">the Neptunes</a>, and more. Celebrity also included several songs written by <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Timberlake</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3p3U04w2DaiBzuYMZnYr00\">Chasez</a>, an opportunity that may have whetted their desire to pursue respective solo careers. \r\n\nFollowing an elaborate stadium tour, the group went on hiatus in mid-2002. <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Timberlake</a> released his solo debut that same year, successfully making the jump from boy band vocalist to critically acclaimed solo artist, while <a href=\"spotify:artist:3p3U04w2DaiBzuYMZnYr00\">Chasez</a> also made his own solo bid with 2004's Schizophrenic. Meanwhile, Joey Fatone launched a movie career and later performed on Broadway, Chris Kirkpatrick starred in the reality TV series Mission: Man Band, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:77rp6J3oOIV6J68tFgVU7Q\">Lance Bass</a> became a certified cosmonaut in the hopes of making it to outer space before moving into TV and radio hosting work, as well as LGBTQ+ advocacy. \r\n\nA compilation, Greatest Hits, appeared in 2005 and the group's website shut down in 2006, however, prompting increased speculation about *NSYNC's future. Responding to such rumors in 2007, <a href=\"spotify:artist:77rp6J3oOIV6J68tFgVU7Q\">Bass</a> informed the Orlando Sentinel that the group had \"definitely broken up\" in light of <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Timberlake</a>'s desire to continue his solo career. In 2013, the group briefly reunited at the MTV Video Music Awards, performing a medley of their hits \"Girlfriend\" and \"Bye Bye Bye,\" just prior to <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Timberlake</a> receiving the <a href=\"spotify:artist:3fMbdgg4jU18AjLCKBhRSm\">Michael Jackson</a> Video Vanguard Award. All four members of *NSYNC (except for <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Timberlake</a>) also appeared together at Coachella in 2019 where they joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:66CXWjxzNUsdJxJ2JdwvnR\">Ariana Grande</a> on-stage for a series of songs, including \"Tearing Up My Heart.\" The official comeback wouldn't happen until 2023, when all five members reunited on the Video Music Awards stage, where they presented an award to <a href=\"spotify:artist:06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02\">Taylor Swift</a>. This public return coincided with the release of \"Better Place,\" which was featured on the soundtrack to Trolls Band Together. Produced with Shellback, the track was the first new material from the beloved boy band in over 15 years. ~ Matt Collar & Andrew Leahey, Rovi",

        "biography": "Over the last decade, DJ Snake has achieved the kind of rarefied and wildly transformative success that few artists ever come close to attaining. Originally from a housing project on the outskirts of Paris, the multi-platinum-selling DJ/producer has shattered industry records with smash hits such as “Taki Taki,” earned diamond certification from the RIAA for &#34;Lean On&#34; (with Major Lazer), delivered era-defining bangers like “Turn Down for What” (with Lil Jon), and made history as the first artist to perform atop the roof of the Arc de Triomphe. Along with repeatedly turning out tracks that top the charts around the world—including three songs that have surpassed a staggering billion streams on Spotify—the multi-award-winning phenom brings his boundary-pushing ingenuity to music that builds unexpected and undeniably powerful bridges between vastly different cultures and genres.\n\n(“I grew up with people from different origins such as India, West Indies to Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East,” he told Rolling Stone in recent years. “We’ve always been inspired by each other.”) Taking his stage name from his former moniker as a graffiti artist, he started DJ-ing in his early teens and soon dropped out of high school to work at a famed Paris record shop, then immersed himself in music production at the age of 19 to become a decade later one of the most important electronic music artist in the world.",

        "biography": "South Korean quintet ITZY put an energetic spin on K-pop, serving buoyant electronic dance anthems with uplifting lyrics. Debuting at the close of the 2010s, they released their Top Three EP It'z Icy in July 2019, followed by March 2020's It'z Me. More Top Five sets appeared, including 2020's Not Shy and 2021's Guess Who. In late 2021, the band released their first full-length, the chart-topping Crazy in Love. The following year, they hit a U.S. chart peak with their Top Ten EP Checkmate. The group remained prolific, following it with two more EPs, including 2023's Kill My Doubt. They again topped the Korean charts with 2024's Born to Be and returned that same year with the Gold EP.\r\n\nJoining <a href=\"spotify:artist:7n2Ycct7Beij7Dj7meI4X0\">Twice</a> on <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22JYP+Entertainment%22\">JYP Entertainment</a>'s girl group roster, ITZY is comprised of Yeji, Lia, Ryujin, Chaeryeong, and Yuna. Through the mid-2010s, most group members competed on various television survival shows before <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22JYP%22\">JYP</a> put them together as the five-piece ITZY. They debuted in January 2019 and issued their first single, \"Dalla Dalla\" b/w \"Want It?\" These hit tracks appeared on their summertime debut EP, It'z Icy, which rose to the Top Three in Korea and placed within the Top 20 on both the U.S. Heatseekers and World Albums charts. The propulsive lead single \"Icy\" peaked at number two on the Billboard World Songs chart. Their follow-up EP, It'z Me, appeared in March 2020 and topped the Korean pop chart, as did their third outing, Not Shy, which arrived in August. \r\n\nAnother Top Five Korean EP, Guess Who, was released in 2021. The short set was ITZY's first appearance on the main Billboard 200 chart. Months later, they bested that showing with their much-anticipated full-length debut, Crazy in Love, which peaked just outside the U.S. Top Ten. The \"Loco\"-featuring set also topped the Billboard World Albums and Independent Albums charts while rising to number two in Korea. A non-album single, the Japanese-language \"Voltage,\" arrived in April 2022. Months later, they landed in the U.S. Top Ten for the first time with their fifth EP, Checkmate, which featured the single \"Sneakers.\" The group closed the year with a sixth EP, Cheshire. Led by the single \"Cake,\" ITZY's seventh EP, Kill My Doubt, appeared in July 2023. Around the same time, singer Lia went on hiatus from the group due to health concerns. \r\n\nIn January 2024, they returned with their second Korean-language album and third full-length studio album, Born to Be. Heralded by the single \"Untouchable,\" it topped the Circle Albums chart and reached 14 on Billboard's World Albums chart. That October, they delivered their ninth EP, Gold. The release, which marked the return of Lia following her hiatus, found ITZY re-recording several tracks off Born to Be as a quintet. ~ Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi",

        "biography": "As the Lemon Twigs, sons of power pop songwriter/multi-instrumentalist <a href=\"spotify:artist:7INoyxzr0vcNl5pOdGk5iE\">Ronnie D'Addario</a>, Brian and Michael D'Addario channel the '70s singer/songwriter energy of their father's era and add a healthy love of musical theater and an over-the-top performance. The brothers began writing songs at young ages and delivered their 2016 debut album, Do Hollywood, on <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%224AD%22\">4AD</a> at the tail-end of their teenage years. Success came quickly, with critical acclaim and a string of TV appearances as well as extensive touring. They evolved from the conceptual eccentricity of their 2018 sophomore album, Go to School, to a more varied but no less bombastic set of songs on their 2020 album Songs for the General Public, to the emotionally naked sentiments of their more subtle but still wildly eclectic albums like 2023's Everything Harmony and the following year's A Dream Is All We Know.\r\n\nLong Island brothers Brian and Michael D'Addario started the Lemon Twigs while they were still in their teens, each playing multiple instruments, counting guitar, keyboards, drums, horns, and strings among their proficiencies. The boys were raised in a musical home, sons of working musician parents. Along with an interest in theater, early musical influences like <a href=\"spotify:artist:3RTzAwFprBqiskp550eSJX\">Harry Nilsson</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Lpr5wXzWLtDWm1SjNbpPb\">Todd Rundgren</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3sFhA6G1N0gG1pszb6kk1m\">Wings</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2jgPkn6LuUazBoBk6vvjh5\">the Zombies</a>, and other '60s and '70s Baroque pop figures played heavily into the band's sound at a formative time. In 2015, their earliest output arrived in the form of the cassette-only album What We Know. Significant buzz had formed around the group even then, and they signed to indie superpower <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%224AD%22\">4AD</a>, releasing their \"These Words\" b/w \"As Long as We're Together\" single in 2016 and selling the 7\" mostly while on a tour supporting <a href=\"spotify:artist:5PbpKlxQE0Ktl5lcNABoFf\">Carseat Headrest</a>. Their debut album, Do Hollywood, arrived later in the year, produced by <a href=\"spotify:artist:55LHFEtIplWhsfyWZUwkf4\">Foxygen</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:70uAxbEwXzRjLIuTFpdolw\">Jonathan Rado</a>. \r\n\nThe Lemon Twigs embarked on a tour in support of the album with a live version of the band that included Danny Ayala on keyboards and Megan Zeankowski on bass. They returned in September 2017 with Brothers of Destruction, a home-recorded EP written largely during the sessions for Do Hollywood featuring a handful of live staples from their touring set. In August of the next year, sophomore album Go to School arrived, a massive production conceptualized as a musical about a chimpanzee raised by human parents. The ambitious Broadway-inspired record included guest appearances by both of the D'Addario brothers' parents as well as power pop legends <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Lpr5wXzWLtDWm1SjNbpPb\">Todd Rundgren</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6q8Lz8Ef4knDwyHxk76FU8\">Jody Stephens</a>. \r\n\nIn April 2020, the band returned with The Lemon Twigs LIVE, a fundraiser for Coalition for the Homeless culled from live-to-tape recordings from shows in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and California. It was followed in August by their third studio full-length, the <a href=\"spotify:artist:70uAxbEwXzRjLIuTFpdolw\">Rado</a>-co-produced Songs for the General Public. It spent a week on Billboard's Top Current Album Sales chart (number 61). The brothers contributed to <a href=\"spotify:artist:7n5xb6bByE74Aw4ppe858H\">Tim Heidecker</a>'s album Fear of Death, which saw release a month later, and over the next few years also appeared on records by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Lpr5wXzWLtDWm1SjNbpPb\">Rundgren</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Uqu1mEdkUJxPe7s31n1M9\">Weyes Blood</a>. The Twigs began work on their next album in 2020 and spent months refining their new material before resurfacing in early 2023 with the self-produced single \"Corner of My Eye,\" the first song shared in advance of their fourth album Everything Harmony. In addition to their long-running love of glam and theatrical power pop, the band looked to the influence of both mainstream and outsider folk artists for their new set of songs, evoking <a href=\"spotify:artist:70cRZdQywnSFp9pnc2WTCE\">Simon & Garfunkel</a> on some tracks and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7HvQfRNJCvPXTVirKKB0Nn\">Moondog</a> on others. Everything Harmony was released in May of 2023 and was the band's first album with new label <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Captured+Tracks%22\">Captured Tracks</a>. Almost exactly a year later, their next album A Dream Is All We Know was released. It was recorded immediately after the completion of Everything Harmony during a period of intense productivity and featured more string arrangements than other Twigs' albums. ~ Neil Z.

        "biography": "Balancing successful careers in music and acting, award-winning Chinese singer/songwriter, dancer, author, and actor Lay Zhang emerged in the early 2010s as a member of K-pop group <a href=\"spotify:artist:3cjEqqelV9zb4BYE3qDQ4O\">EXO</a>. As he expanded his résumé, he also expanded his international reach, finding chart success throughout Asia and in the U.S. Blending K-pop savvy, hip-hop, and electronic touches, his debut EP, Lose Control, broke records upon its release in 2016, leading to an English-language album, Namanana, in 2018.\r\n\nBorn Yixing Zhang in Changsha, Hunan Province, a young Lay started acting as a child, competing on various television talent shows into the early 2000s. In 2008, he auditioned with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22S.M.+Entertainment%22\">S.M. Entertainment</a>, home to <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hRQKC0gqlZGPrmUKbcchR\">Shinee</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3IniCa6EijyZ3bsY0eTG3C\">NCT</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6gzXCdfYfFe5XKhPKkYqxV\">Super Junior</a>. The label shipped him over to Korea for idol training, where he had a brief stint as a touring dancer with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2hRQKC0gqlZGPrmUKbcchR\">Shinee</a> before officially joining <a href=\"spotify:artist:3cjEqqelV9zb4BYE3qDQ4O\">EXO</a> in 2012. One of 12 founding members, Lay found massive international success with the K-pop outfit, topping charts in Korea, China, and the U.S. Within <a href=\"spotify:artist:3cjEqqelV9zb4BYE3qDQ4O\">EXO</a>, Lay was part of the subgroup <a href=\"spotify:artist:57n0GwAnyELOvq620O2tOJ\">EXO-M</a> alongside Xiumin, Chen, and ex-members <a href=\"spotify:artist:2lbUjuMzHkT4qIECvk2f3L\">Kris Wu</a>, Luhan, and Tao. As <a href=\"spotify:artist:3cjEqqelV9zb4BYE3qDQ4O\">EXO</a> continued to issue albums and tour the world, Lay made steps toward center stage with his 2014 <a href=\"spotify:artist:3cjEqqelV9zb4BYE3qDQ4O\">EXO</a> contributions \"I'm Lay\" and \"I'm Coming.\" \r\n\nThe following year, <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22S.M.%22\">S.M.</a> made a concerted effort to push Lay in his home country. In addition to featuring on reality television shows, Lay also recorded China-specific additions to <a href=\"spotify:artist:3cjEqqelV9zb4BYE3qDQ4O\">EXO</a> album repackages. He also wrote an autobiography, Standing Firm at 24, and joined the casts for multiple feature films, including Kung Fu Yoga with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0wVKXWiOMLfqmFCdCPR7Ar\">Jackie Chan</a>, as well as Ex Files 2, Oh My God, and more. In 2016, Lay issued his Mandarin-language debut EP, Lose Control, a slinky R&B set that included the single \"what U need?\" In addition to topping the Korean charts, it also broke solo artist sales records in Korea while rising to number four on the U.S. World Albums chart. In 2017, he repeated that U.S. chart success with his official first album, Lay 02 Sheep, which also topped the Chinese charts. The album included the singles \"I Need U\" and \"Sheep,\" which later received the remix treatment by DJ Walkzz. Months after Lay 02 Sheep, Lay's second EP, the Christmas-themed Winter Special Gift, was released just in time for the holidays. The short collection landed in the U.S. World Top Ten.\r\n\nIn 2018, Lay set his sights on his burgeoning American audience, appearing with DJ Walkzz for his Lollapalooza set, which promoted their \"Sheep\" collaborative remix. Further penetrating the English-language market, Lay issued his second LP, Namanana, which featured both Mandarin and English versions, as well as a high-profile duet with Michigan pop singer <a href=\"spotify:artist:4GvEc3ANtPPjt1ZJllr5Zl\">Bazzi</a>. The set topped the U.S. Independent and World Albums charts, rising to number 21 on the Billboard 200. ~ Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi",

Trevor is EMMY-nominated and has written music for numerous productions. Eclectic artists like Thelonious Monk, John Denver, and the melodic sense of Nintendo inspire his music. Major influences include Camille Saint-Saëns, Jennifer Higdon, and John Barry.\n\nDistinctly shaped by the Adirondack Mountains and enthralled with music from a young age, Trevor started playing piano at 6 and writing fragments of melodies. Growing up, he played piano on the street and in bars between jobs. He studied at Boston University with the influential Ketty Nez, where he was the first freshman to win the orchestra&#39;s composition contest, and at the Royal College of Music in London where he performed under conductor Bernard Haitink. He also plays french horn. Trevor has worked with traditional Native musicians in awarded co-soundtracks. Trevor gained experience at composer Hans Zimmer&#39;s studio.\n\nSheet music and merch available on trevorkowalski.com. Trevor is based in Los Angeles.

That it coheres into an entrancing whole is resolutely jaw-dropping. \n\nKarin Ann’s ascent began in her teens: Early songs like “looking at porn,” and “babyboy” indicated a fearlessness in confronting mental health and LGBTQ&#43; issues.

The group released the Japanese EP Wave, then two Korean EPs, I've Mine and 2024's IVE Switch.\r\n\nFormed in 2021 by the Seoul-based Starship Entertainment, IVE features the talents of Yujin, Gaeul, Rei, Wonyoung, Liz, and Leeseo.

IVE (a stylized spelling of the contraction \"I've\" or \"I have\"), made their debut in December 2021 with the single \"Eleven,\" which topped the Korean Gaon Album chart. It also reached the Top Ten of Billboard's World Digital Songs Sales chart and cracked the Japan Hot 100. A second single, \"Love Dive,\" arrived in April 2022, also hitting number one in Korea. The group returned that August with their third single, \"After Like. \"Kitsch\" and \"I Am\" arrived in early 2023 and appeared on the group's first full-length studio LP, I've IVE, later that year. Wave, an EP sung in Japanese and intended for the Japanese market, appeared in May and topped the country's charts. The Korean-language EP I've Mine was released in October, and was another multi-national success. Their second Korean-language EP IVE Switch arrived in 2024. ~ Matt Collar, Rovi",

This belief that Sishii holds is at the heart of his endeavour to release a new record every week. \n\nWorking with stellar producers and songwriters like <a href=\"spotify:artist:6n6eA9x4MjOENHu6NgumKu\" data-name=\"Jaydon Lewis\">Jaydon Lewis</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6omm7OGZMQZ2XODf4JVKnQ\" data-name=\"Manana\">Manana</a> and The Imports, Sishii is carving out a lane for himself and working tirelessly toward mastery as a writer, producer and performer.\n\nSee you with new music, every Friday.",

Formed in 2015, the band has performed throughout the U.S. and U.K., held its own alongside Jeff Rosenstock and The Hold Steady, and even been animated into an episode of Cartoon Network&#39;s Craig of the Creek.\n\nOn its self-titled 2016 EP, the band explored bleak adulthood, writing about bad jobs, corrupt leaders, frustrated dreams and gentrifying cities. Tell No One, released in 2018 on Don Giovanni records, was Bad Moves&#39; debut LP: 12 songs about confronting old secrets and stumbling into self-discovery, wrapped in a sound that hometown weekly Washington City Paper called &#34;exuberant catharsis, the type of pop that makes you breathe deep and shout.&#34; The album was recorded at Philadelphia&#39;s Headroom Studios by Joe Reinhart (Hop Along, Algernon Cadwallader).\n\nIn 2020, the group paired up again with Reinhart to produce its second LP, Untenable. Spikier sounds framed lyrics about the places where instability erodes our lives — tipped wages, service industry jobs, our self-image as groomed for public consumption via social media. The title is a nod to the overwhelming feeling of unsustainability that permeates life right now, but there’s a melodic sweetness and a fair bit of hope there, too. Uncertain times are also an opportunity for change.",

On his new album Where I’ve Been Isn’t Where I’m Going, the Virginia-bred singer/songwriter charts a cinematic road trip through the wilds of the American West, bringing a powerful new depth to his storytelling while pushing further into the country/folk-inspired sound he’s explored in recent years. The latest turn in a dynamic career that began with the breakout success of his viral hit “Jeff Gordon”—and also includes such triumphs as appearing on the soundtrack to the Academy Award-winning blockbuster Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse—Where I’ve Been, isn’t Where I’m Going is the most boldly realized work yet from a singular new voice on the music scene.",

        "biography": "Bryson Tiller is a Kentucky-born singer and rapper became one of the key breakout stars in 2010s contemporary R&B with the single \"Don't\" and a descriptively titled parent album, T R A P S O U L (2015), a moody if swaggering set of slow jams that neologized a subgenre Tiller took to the mainstream with multi-platinum certifications and Grammy nominations. His next two studio albums, True to Self (2017) and A N N I V E R S A R Y (2019), reached numbers one and five, respectively, on the Billboard 200. Tiller's additional hits as a featured artist and duet partner include highlights by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QHgL1lAIqAw0HtD7YldmP\">DJ Khaled</a>'s \"Wild Thoughts,\" <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Y7RZ31TRPVadSFVy1o8os\">H.E.R.</a>'s \"Could've Been,\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:59wfkuBoNyhDMQGCljbUbA\">Diddy</a>'s \"Gotta Move On.\" Anchored by the hit single \"Whatever She Wants,\" he released his eponymous fourth album in April 2024.\r\n\nTiller started singing and rapping as a high schooler in his native Louisville, Kentucky, and in his late teens released a mixtape, Killer Instinct, Vol. 1. He was just into his twenties when SoundCloud uploads such as \"Don't,\" \"Break Bread,\" and \"Let 'Em Know\" brought him greater recognition. <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Y5TRrQiqgUO4S36tzjIRZ\">Timbaland</a> reached out to collaborate and convinced Tiller to quit his job to do so. <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> expressed interest in signing Tiller to his <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22OVO+Sound%22\">OVO Sound</a> label, but after some deliberation, Tiller accepted an offer from <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22RCA%22\">RCA</a>, and made his major-label debut in May 2015 with the commercial release of \"Don't.\" The sparse ballad peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 (and eventually went multi-platinum). The full-length T R A P S O U L followed a few months later and reached number eight on the Billboard 200. Within six months, the album was certified platinum, supported by additional multi-platinum hits \"Exchange\" and \"Sorry Not Sorry,\" the latter of which was co-produced by <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Y5TRrQiqgUO4S36tzjIRZ\">Timbaland</a>. \"Exchange,\" a number 26 pop hit, was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best R&B Song. \r\n\nFeatured appearances and non-album singles as a headliner led to the May 2017 release of Tiller's second album, True to Self. Another set dominated by thumping slow jams, it went straight to number one. Around the same time, Tiller was featured beside <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a> on <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QHgL1lAIqAw0HtD7YldmP\">DJ Khaled</a>'s number two hit \"Wild Thoughts.\" Additional featured appearances and other stray tracks preceded Tiller's third album. Most notable were duets with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7gSjFKpVmDgC2MMsnN8CYq\">Jazmine Sullivan</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Y7RZ31TRPVadSFVy1o8os\">H.E.R.</a>, respectively \"Insecure\" (for the soundtrack of the like-titled series) and the Grammy-nominated \"Could've Been.\" Issued in October 2020, A N N I V E R S A R Y landed at number five and contained \"Outta Time,\" featuring guest vocals by <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a> and production from <a href=\"spotify:artist:4vQEj0zCIa6CvDruKZCLNk\">40</a>, Nineteen85, and Vinylz. A year later, coinciding with both Halloween and the tenth anniversary of his first mixtape, Tiller offered his second tape, Killer Instinct 2: The Nightmare Before. Another holiday-themed recording, A Different Christmas, was out the next month with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1uNFoZAHBGtllmzznpCI3s\">Justin Bieber</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:26AHtbjWKiwYzsoGoUZq53\">Pentatonix</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7jZMxhsB8djyIbYmoiJSTs\">Kiana Ledé</a> on the guest list. The EP included mostly original songs and an update of \"Winter Wonderland.\" In 2022, Tiller guested on <a href=\"spotify:artist:59wfkuBoNyhDMQGCljbUbA\">Diddy</a>'s \"Gotta Move On\" and released the solo single \"Outside,\" followed a year later by \"Down Like That.\" Previously issued as part of a SoundCloud mixtape, \"Whatever She Wants\" was given a wider release in early 2024 and became a significant hit, reaching the Top 20 in the U.S. and U.K. Tiller included it on his self-titled fourth album in April. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi",

From the release of his debut self-produced track, “supїdo,” in August 2023 to his 2024 viral tracks like “kompa pasión” and “Don’t Copy My Flow,” Frozy has become one of the top artists/producers in Ukraine and has captured the attention of a global audience.\n\nFrozy&#39;s success is particularly remarkable given the challenges he has faced, including closed borders and the difficulties of living in Ukraine during a time of conflict. Despite these obstacles, Frozy remains dedicated to his music, focusing on creating beats for a bustling musical community. \n\n &#34;It is a crazy feeling that many people like my music, liking what I create,” he says. “It&#39;s crazy crazy thing.” &#34;I just know when music starts getting boring, you are forced to invent something by trying everything,&#34; Frozy says. &#34;It’s all about improvisation and inspiration. I sit and try to make something—just little sketches and quick demos. The next day, I check what I have and finish the best ideas.&#34; \n\nFrozy’s resilience and innovative spirit are unstoppable. His ability to blend various genres and navigate challenges speaks to his dedication and passion. As he continues to push boundaries and experiment with new sounds, there seems to be no end to how far he can go. Music is essential to his soul, and he wants to share more and more.",

Their debut EP, Beast Is the B2ST, appeared in the fall of 2009 and charted in South Korea. In early 2010, the sextet signed with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Universal+Music+Group%22\">Universal Music Group</a> for international distribution and followed up with four EPs before year's end: Shock of the New Era, Mastermind, Lights Go On Again, and their first digital album, My Story. 2010 also saw a Japanese compilation titled BEAST: Japan Premium Edition, and their uptempo, Auto-Tuned song \"Crazy\" was featured in the film Attack of the Gas Station 2. Their debut full-length, Fiction and Fact, arrived in the spring of 2011 and hit number one on South Korea's album chart. The Japanese long-player So Beast appeared later that year. The band went on an international tour of Asia, Europe, and the Americas in 2012, and The Midnight Sun EP was released, reaching number 15 on Billboard's World Albums chart. It was followed by their second chart-topping Korean LP, How to Love, How to Love, in 2013. The following year, the EP Good Luck was issued, along with another Japanese collection, BEAST: Japan Best, and the Time EP. In 2015, the group decided to go it alone and created their own independent music label called B2ST Music. ~ Marcy Donelson, Rovi",

        "biography": "A distinct force in contemporary R&B, SZA has set herself apart with a vulnerable and casually poetic songwriting style and a voice conveying a multitude of emotions with subtle twists and turns. She established herself with a trio of spaced-out EPs and collaborations with the likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a>, and continued her ascent with Ctrl (2017), a Top Ten album that resulted in five Grammy nominations, including Best New Artist. These accolades proved to be no fluke, as SZA earned almost as many Grammy nominations the next year by assisting <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a> with \"All the Stars,\" a Top Ten hit, only one in a slew of platinum singles she has scored as a headliner or featured artist. Her rich and complex second album, SOS (2022), went straight to number one on the Billboard 200, produced four Top Ten pop singles -- including the chart-topping revenge fantasy \"Kill Bill\" -- and earned the artist three Grammy awards. \r\n\nSolána Imani Rowe was born in St. Louis and raised in New Jersey, where she excelled in high school gymnastics and cheerleading. After leaving college, Rowe shuffled around different jobs and recorded on the side, influenced by the diverse and maverick likes of <a href=\"spotify:artist:1YzCsTRb22dQkh9lghPIrp\">Billie Holiday</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7w29UYBi0qsHi5RTcv3lmA\">Björk</a>, as well as <a href=\"spotify:artist:34EP7KEpOjXcM2TCat1ISk\">Wu-Tang Clan</a>, whose <a href=\"spotify:artist:4iCwCMnqsNZ6atvRiADgtn\">RZA</a> inspired her performing name. She self-released a pair of dreamy and alluring EPs, 2012's See.SZA.Run and 2013's S, and shortly thereafter signed with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Top+Dawg+Entertainment%22\">Top Dawg Entertainment</a>. SZA had been on <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22TDE%22\">TDE</a>'s radar since 2011, when label co-founder Terrence \"Punch\" Henderson was handed material at the CMJ Music Marathon.\r\n\nOnce their agreement was in place, <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Top+Dawg%22\">Top Dawg</a> and SZA didn't waste any time. In April 2014, SZA made her label debut with Z, a trippy third EP that entered the Billboard 200 at number 39 with featured appearances from fellow <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22TDE%22\">TDE</a> artists <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6aaMZ3fcfLv4tEbmY7bjRM\">Isaiah Rashad</a>, as well as one from <a href=\"spotify:artist:1anyVhU62p31KFi8MEzkbf\">Chance the Rapper</a>. By the end of 2016, SZA was a highly valued collaborator herself. She appeared on high-profile <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22TDE%22\">TDE</a> releases from <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Lamar</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6aaMZ3fcfLv4tEbmY7bjRM\">Rashad</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5IcR3N7QB1j6KBL8eImZ8m\">ScHoolboy Q</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:28ExwzUQsvgJooOI0X1mr3\">Jay Rock</a>, co-wrote <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a>'s \"Feeling Myself\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY\">Travis Scott</a>'s \"OK Alright,\" and co-wrote and appeared on <a href=\"spotify:artist:5pKCCKE2ajJHZ9KAiaK11H\">Rihanna</a>'s \"Consideration.\"        \r\n\nPrimed for the spotlight in 2017, SZA followed through that June with her first album. Released through <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22TDE%22\">TDE</a>'s arrangement with major-label <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22RCA%22\">RCA</a>, the sharply defined Ctrl debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, and on its way to platinum status yielded a pair of multi-platinum singles in \"Love Galore\" and \"The Weekend,\" both of which went Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. SZA also broadened her audience that year with contributions to <a href=\"spotify:artist:04gDigrS5kc9YWfZHwBETP\">Maroon 5</a>'s Top Ten \"What Lovers Do\" and a remix of <a href=\"spotify:artist:163tK9Wjr9P9DmM0AVK7lm\">Lorde</a>'s \"Homemade Dynamite.\" Up for five Grammys, SZA was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Urban Contemporary Album, plus Best R&B Song (\"Supermodel\"), Best R&B Performance (\"The Weekend\"), and Best Rap/Sung Performance (\"Love Galore\"). \r\n\nSZA didn't win in any of the categories, but at the time of the ceremony in January 2019, she was already scaling back up the Hot 100 with \"All the Stars,\" recorded with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a> for Black Panther: The Album. Another multi-platinum hit, the single peaked at number seven and was nominated in four categories -- including Record of the Year and Song of the Year, two of \"the big four\" -- at the next Grammy ceremony. During the rest of 2019, SZA added to her between-albums output, which already included <a href=\"spotify:artist:4kYSro6naA4h99UJvo89HB\">Cardi B</a>'s \"I Do,\" with the Game of Thrones commission \"Power Is Power\" and co-starring roles on <a href=\"spotify:artist:0QHgL1lAIqAw0HtD7YldmP\">DJ Khaled</a>'s \"Just Us\" and <a href=\"spotify:artist:246dkjvS1zLTtiykXe5h60\">Post Malone</a>'s \"Staring at the Sun.\" In 2020, she paired with <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Justin Timberlake</a> on the song \"The Other Side\" for the Trolls World Tour soundtrack. She also released <a href=\"spotify:artist:0KuF7reCTOZwV7YJnHQqgr\">the Neptunes</a>-produced track \"Hit Different\" -- a number 29 pop hit featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:7c0XG5cIJTrrAgEC3ULPiq\">Ty Dolla $ign</a> -- and \"Good Days,\" which reached number nine. \r\n\nA comparatively quiet year for SZA, 2021 was highlighted by a featured appearance on <a href=\"spotify:artist:5cj0lLjcoR7YOSnhnX0Po5\">Doja Cat</a>'s uptempo single \"Kiss Me More,\" a number three pop hit. SZA also contributed \"The Anonymous Ones\" to the soundtrack for the coming-of-age film Dear Evan Hansen. \"No Love\" (headlined by <a href=\"spotify:artist:57LYzLEk2LcFghVwuWbcuS\">Summer Walker</a>) and \"I Hate U\" appeared at the end of the year; the latter reached number seven on the pop chart. At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards the following February, \"Good Days\" was up for Best R&B Song, and \"Kiss Me More\" won for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. A deluxe edition of Ctrl, including seven previously unreleased songs, appeared that June, five years after the album was originally released. \r\n\nIn December 2022, SZA delivered her second LP, SOS, on which she teamed with a deep roster of production and songwriting associates tied together by extensive input from Rob Bisel, Carter Lang, and ThankGod4Cody. The album topped both the Billboard 200 and R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, with \"Nobody Gets Me,\" \"Kill Bill,\" and the <a href=\"spotify:artist:3aVoqlJOYx31lH1gibGDt3\">Babyface</a> collaboration \"Snooze\" following \"I Hate U\" and \"Good Days\" into the Top Ten. \"Kill Bill\" became SZA's first number one pop hit, and \"Snooze\" received another boost with an acoustic version assisted by <a href=\"spotify:artist:1uNFoZAHBGtllmzznpCI3s\">Justin Bieber</a>. After SZA topped the Hot 100 a second time, featured on <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>'s \"Slime You Out,\" she received a leading nine nominations at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, including nods for Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year -- all of the \"the big four\" categories for which she was eligible. SOS won Best Progressive R&B Album, \"Snooze\" took Best R&B Song, and the <a href=\"spotify:artist:1r1uxoy19fzMxunt3ONAkG\">Phoebe Bridgers</a> collaboration \"Ghost in the Machine\" earned Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi",

        "biography": "Since making her debut in 2019, Gracie Abrams has emerged as one of the most compelling songwriters of her generation. A consummate songwriter who names Joni Mitchell as her most formative influence, she penned her first song at age 8, then went on to amass a devoted following on the strength of her emotionally intimate lyrics. Her debut project minor was released in summer 2020 and features her beloved singles “21”, “I miss you, I’m sorry” and “Long Sleeves”. In 2021, Abrams returned with This Is What It Feels Like, a 12-track project exploring such complex emotions as self-betrayal, insecurity, and failed attempts at connection. Her long-awaited debut album Good Riddance, produced by Aaron Dessner of The National, found Abrams opening up about a recent period of intense transformation, bringing even more honesty and depth to her lyrical storytelling. Praising Good Riddance as “one of 2023’s best debuts”, Rolling Stone hailed Abrams as “one of pop’s buzziest young artists”. Now the 2024 sophomore album, The Secret of Us, embodies all the breathless urgency of spilling your heart out to your closest friend at the end of a whirlwind night. Created soon after Abrams took the stage at stadiums across the country as support for Taylor Swift’s blockbuster Eras Tour, The Secret of Us marks her first time taking a hands-on role in the production process. Co-produced by Abrams and Dessner, The Secret of Us ultimately brings a bold new effervescence to her songwriting.",

        "biography": "Youth Lagoon, the alias of Idaho-based producer and composer Trevor Powers, returns with a new single/video, “My Beautiful Girl.” Much like entering a dream, Powers’ worlds often feel like oddly familiar fragments of a childhood memory. “Songwriting just feels like receiving messages from a portal and transcribing them,” says Powers. “Some nights I’ll wake up at 3 am and words feel like they’re bludgeoning my skull with a baseball bat. Most times, I don’t even know what they mean. I don’t think I’m supposed to. It’s only my job to listen, be constant, and write them down. And if I’m not a faithful steward of that job, those words will find someone else who is.” \n\nIn 2023, Powers released the acclaimed Heaven Is a Junkyard, an album of warped Americana that brought his focus back home. “I realized everything worth writing about is happening inside my house or right next door,” he says. “There’s an eternity of secrets in the American suburbs.” With Pitchfork awarding it “Best New Music” as well as landing in their top 50 albums of the year and The Guardian dubbing it a “masterpiece,” Youth Lagoon’s first album in 8 years pushed the project into a neo-western realm both deeply literary and musically vast, centered around an upright piano and static-coated electronics. “I killed off Youth Lagoon years ago because I lost who I was,” says Powers. “Then life jumped me in an alley and gave me a beating. That suffering changed my frequency. Now my ideas are a river. I can’t keep up.”",

A spellbinding collage of snaky pop hooks, neon melodies, and deeply personal singer-songwriter lyricism, the album melds high-tech songcraft with quick wit, irrepressible spirit, and an impressive breadth of vision that showcases glowing synths and big beats over the trippy guitars that defined 2019’s acclaimed debut, TWENTY TWENTY. Blissed-out bops like “Change” see Keery delving deep into a broad spectrum of eclectic influences, deconstructing hyperpop, euphoric psychedelia, spiky new wave, and symphonic 70’s rock into something utterly unique via dauntless melodies and technical innovation. \n \nDECIDE is out everywhere now.",

        "biography": "Record-breaking South Korean boy band BTS (aka Bangtan Boys) deliver an energetic blend of dance-pop and hip-hop with deeply introspective lyrics that helped them build a devoted global following while also making them one of the most successful Korean exports in the world. Debuting in the early 2010s with their Skool trilogy, they steadily expanded their audience until breaking into the mainstream consciousness with the Love Yourself series. After the platinum-certified Love Yourself: Tear became their first number one effort outside of their home country, the compilation Love Yourself: Answer found them topping charts in Canada and Japan. By 2020, international fervor reached a peak with their fourth release, Map of the Soul: 7, which topped the charts in over 20 countries. Hitting another milestone that summer, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to top the U.S. singles chart with their retro-disco track \"Dynamite\" from their chart-topping fifth set, Be. The following year, they notched three more Billboard number ones, including \"Butter\" and the <a href=\"spotify:artist:4gzpq5DPGxSnKTe4SA8HAU\">Coldplay</a> collaboration \"My Universe.\" A sprawling anthology, Proof, which chronicled their first decade, landed in the summer of 2022.\r\n\nFormed by producer Bang Si Hyuk, the septet's lineup includes <a href=\"spotify:artist:2auC28zjQyVTsiZKNgPRGs\">RM</a> (<a href=\"spotify:artist:2auC28zjQyVTsiZKNgPRGs\">Kim Namjoon</a>), team leader and rapper; Jin (Kim Seokjin), singer; Suga (Min Yoongi), rapper; <a href=\"spotify:artist:0b1sIQumIAsNbqAoIClSpy\">J-Hope</a> (<a href=\"spotify:artist:0b1sIQumIAsNbqAoIClSpy\">Jung Hoseok</a>), rapper and choreographer; Jimin (Jimin Park), singer and choreographer; V (Kim Taehyung), singer; and <a href=\"spotify:artist:6HaGTQPmzraVmaVxvz6EUc\">Jungkook</a> (Jungkook Jeon), singer, rapper, and choreographer. In addition to production and composition, the members of BTS also write their own lyrics, which tackle topics like mental health, self-acceptance, and empowerment. With their youthful blend of club-worthy dance anthems, stirring love ballads, and aggressive rapping, BTS connected with a devoted fan base (dubbed \"ARMY\") and set themselves apart from the K-pop industrial machine when they debuted in 2013 with the first installment of their \"School Trilogy\" series, 2 Cool 4 Skool. A few months later, they released the second EP of the saga, O!RUL8,2? The trilogy was completed with Skool Luv Affair, which was released around Valentine's Day in 2014. \r\n\nLater that year, BTS issued their full-length debut album, Dark & Wild, featuring the single \"Danger.\" As their fan base grew and international tours sold out, they released The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 1 in April 2015 and the follow-up, Pt. 2, some months later in November. They embarked on a massive world tour as The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2 topped a record-setting six international music charts, including Billboard's World Albums chart. After four weeks, they set a record as the first K-pop act to achieve such a feat. \r\n\nThe group continued to break records with the release of their sophomore LP, Wings. Released in late 2016, Wings not only became the first BTS effort to debut atop both the Korean album and song charts, but they were the third K-pop act to land in the Canadian Hot 100. However, the album's impact was most apparent on the Billboard charts. The best showing to date for a K-pop act, Wings debuted in the Top 30 of the Billboard 200 -- both their highest U.S. chart debut and most sales to date -- making BTS the first K-pop artists with three albums to enter the main album charts. (Wings became their sixth Top Three hit -- and second number one -- on the World Albums chart.) They also became the first K-pop act to spend four weeks on the charts. Wings continued the artistic and creative growth for the septet, featuring seven solo tracks that showcased the personality of each member. Four months later, BTS re-released the album as You Never Walk Alone. The updated version added four new songs to the original Wings track listing, including the singles \"Spring Day\" and \"Not Today.\" With their presence in the United States continuing to expand, the group went on to win the Top Social Artist Award at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards. Their fifth EP, Love Yourself: Her, arrived that September and became the first K-pop album to debut in the Billboard 200's Top Ten, entering the chart at number seven.\r\n\nIn early 2018, BTS received their first double-platinum certifications in Japan and became the first Korean act to receive two gold certifications in the U.S. That spring, they issued their third Japanese LP, Face Yourself, which featured Japanese versions of tracks from Wings and Love Yourself: Her. The set -- which included just two previously unreleased songs -- debuted just outside the Top 40 on the Billboard 200. The next month, BTS released their third official full-length, Love Yourself: Tear, which included the single \"Fake Love.\" Days later, they returned to the Billboard Music Awards, performing and winning Top Social Artist for the second year in a row. Their Billboard success continued when Love Yourself: Tear soared to the top of the Billboard 200, becoming the first foreign-language chart-topper on the U.S. chart in over a decade. BTS repeated the feat that summer with the conclusion to the trilogy, Love Yourself: Answer. The compilation featured a handful of new tracks, including lead single \"Idol,\" packaged with previously released songs from Her and Tear, as well as some remixes and a <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a>-assisted version of \"Idol.\" For their contributions to spreading Korea's cultural influence around the world, each member of BTS was awarded cultural merit medals by government officials, the youngest recipients to ever be granted the honor.\r\n\nRiding the international success of the Love Yourself series, the boys closed the era with a sold-out global stadium tour, which primed them for the start of the next BTS wave: Map of the Soul: Persona. The first single from the 2019 album, \"Persona,\" showcased a solo <a href=\"spotify:artist:2auC28zjQyVTsiZKNgPRGs\">RM</a> referencing both Carl Jung and BTS' own 2014 track \"Intro: Skool Luv Affair,\" while the follow-up \"Boy with Luv\" recruited American singer <a href=\"spotify:artist:26VFTg2z8YR0cCuwLzESi2\">Halsey</a>. While \"Boy with Luv\" climbed into the Top Ten of the Hot 100, the album topped the Billboard 200, becoming BTS' third number one in a year. Before the next official release, the band found themselves the focus of a mobile game, BTS World. The accompanying companion album, BTS World: Original Soundtrack, included a new track by the crew, as well as a trio of collaborations with guests <a href=\"spotify:artist:25uiPmTg16RbhZWAqwLBy5\">Charli XCX</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xylc3o4UrD53lo9CvFvVg\">Zara Larsson</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4MCBfE4596Uoi2O4DtmEMz\">Juice WRLD</a>. Not an official BTS album per se, the bulk of the set featured instrumental compositions by Kang Minkook, who wrote one theme song per BTS member, and showcased tracks by Korean indie duo Okdal and <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Big+Hit%22\">Big Hit</a> labelmate <a href=\"spotify:artist:6MLmtxHkGVuPhYIcMUm1AQ\">Lee Hyun</a>. Despite not being an actual BTS effort, the soundtrack still managed to land at number 72 on the Billboard 200 while simultaneously topping the Korean charts.\r\n\nAfter a brief hiatus from the spotlight, BTS returned in earnest in 2020. The same week that Love Yourself: Answer became the first South Korean album to be certified platinum in the U.S., they joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:7jVv8c5Fj3E9VhNjxT4snq\">Lil Nas X</a> on the Grammy Awards stage to perform <a href=\"spotify:artist:2auC28zjQyVTsiZKNgPRGs\">RM</a>'s \"Seoul Town Road\" version of the rapper's hit single. The following month, the group released their fourth Korean-language LP and second number one U.S. hit, Map of the Soul: 7. The set merged highlights from Map of the Soul: Persona with over a dozen new tracks, including the single \"Black Swan\" and collaborations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3WGpXCj9YhhfX11TToZcXP\">Troye Sivan</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0wnYgCeP013HkKoOyC5V32\">Allie X</a> (\"Louder Than Bombs\") and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5WUlDfRSoLAfcVSX1WnrxN\">Sia</a> (the digital-only \"On\"). They extended the Map of the Soul era in 2020 with their fourth Japanese-language effort, Map of the Soul: 7 - The Journey, which reimagined tracks from Map of the Soul: 7, Map of the Soul: Persona, and Love Yourself: Answer for their Japanese fans. As for English-speaking fans, the group released their first track sung entirely in that language later in the summer. The disco-funk \"Dynamite\" broke streaming records within hours of release and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, making BTS the first all-South Korean act to top the U.S. chart. The same week, the group made their first appearance on the MTV Video Music Awards, performing \"Dynamite\" for a virtual audience. The track was the first taste of their next album era, which was inaugurated with the November release of Be. Recorded while in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic, the effort featured increased input by each member of the septet, which included songwriting, production, and overall design. The same week that Be became their fifth album to debut atop the Billboard 200, BTS also scored their second consecutive number one single with \"Life Goes On.\" To cap off a banner year, South Korea's National Assembly passed a revised law that pushed the age for mandatory military service from 28 to 30, sparing Jin an early hiatus from the group and allowing them to continue contributing to South Korea's GDP, of which almost $5 billion was attributed to BTS in 2019.\r\n\nIn February 2021, BTS performed an MTV Unplugged set, which featured stripped-down takes on songs from Be (\"Dynamite,\" \"Telepathy,\" \"Blue & Grey,\" and \"Life Goes On\") as well as a faithful rendition of <a href=\"spotify:artist:4gzpq5DPGxSnKTe4SA8HAU\">Coldplay</a>'s \"Fix You.\" Months later, the group returned with the <a href=\"spotify:artist:6HaGTQPmzraVmaVxvz6EUc\">Jungkook</a>-penned single \"Film Out\" from their Japanese-language compilation BTS, The Best. By the time summer rolled around, the boys were ready with another English-language single, the Grammy-nominated \"Butter.\" Released in May, the track broke a streaming premiere record after amassing over 20 million views in an hour and went on to become the group's fourth chart-topper on the Billboard Hot 100. Various remixes were released in \"Hotter,\" \"Sweeter,\" and \"Cooler\" versions -- as well as a standalone cut featuring a <a href=\"spotify:artist:181bsRPaVXVlUKXrxwZfHK\">Megan Thee Stallion</a> verse -- which kept the track planted at number one for weeks. Eventually released as a multi-format physical single, it was paired with the <a href=\"spotify:artist:6eUKZXaKkcviH0Ku9w2n3V\">Ed Sheeran</a>-penned song \"Permission to Dance,\" which hit number one in the U.S. and across Asia. Their third U.S. chart-topper of 2021 arrived in September when they joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:4gzpq5DPGxSnKTe4SA8HAU\">Coldplay</a> for \"My Universe\" from the English band's Music of the Spheres. Capping yet another banner year, they took home Artist of the Year, Favorite Pop Group, and Favorite Pop Song at that November's American Music Awards. That same month, BTS kicked off the U.S. portion of their Permission to Dance on Stage concert series in Los Angeles, concluding months later in April 2022 in Las Vegas. Just days before that Vegas residency, they performed \"Butter\" at the 64th Grammy Awards. That May, they took home an additional trio of Billboard Music Awards, making them the group with the most awards in the history of the show. Weeks later, BTS visited the White House to speak with President Joe Biden about the surge in Asian American hate crimes. In early June, the group celebrated their first decade together with the three-disc compilation Proof, which featured a handful of new tracks (including the top 20 Hot 100 single \"Yet to Come\") spread over a best-of disc, a disc of curated tracks personally chosen by each member, and a disc of demos and unreleased songs. A single, \"The Planet,\" arrived in May 2023 as part of the soundtrack to the animated film Bastions. ~ Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi",

Although her skills are varied, it&#39;s her pop music that truly represents her star power. The singer specialises in passionate piano ballads featuring fluid saxophone melodies and easy-swaying guitars, but she has also seamlessly developed a pulsing dance-pop sound. &#39;<a href=\"spotify:track:0bnhPU20rQxFngLtbGFjvO\" data-name=\"Xin Hay Thu Tha (Feat.

        "biography": "It’s damn near impossible to start a band these days, and it’s even more impossible to actually make great music once you do. Swedish four-piece Girl Scout are a band quite happy to defy the odds. Throwing down the gauntlet with a rave received debut EP, ‘Real Life Human Garbage’, the band has earned comparisons to everyone from The Breeders to Snail Mail, all while embellishing a sonic finesse that, often, outstretches those names in technicolor 4K. NME, DORK, Under The Radar and more tipped them as ones to watch 2024, others augur them with the same shooting star career as Wet Leg. Features in Clash, The Times, The Guardian, Gaffa, Atwood, Billboard, and too many more to name them all here sang the band’s paean as one of the most innovative and energetic newcomers around. \n\nGirl Scout continue to weave the tapestry of a sound that has already become so big and unbelievable, pulling patient pleasures from eras they didn’t even exist in but have strong, reverberating reverence for. Their critically acclaimed second EP ‘Granny Music’ arrived to much critical acclaim spawning some huge tunes - &#39;Monster&#39; being one.\n\nHaving now toured the UK and Europe extensively - including a run of shows with Alvvays, the band  released their biggest song to-date - the gigantic &#39;I Just Needed You To Know&#39;.  This song is pricked up ears around the world with even the New York Times jumping on it.  And now with new single &#39;Honey&#39;, another chapter begins....",

Ebullient on the surface, ‘Eulogy’ is a deeply intentional release for Ayesha, as dynamic and playful as it is earnest and existential. ‘Eulogy’ triggers the clearest view of her creative ambition and motivations, set to a steady garage beat that morphs through strings and stripped back piano sections. Humanising perceived world glory from the inside, Ayesha asks listeners to remember her faults just as we should celebrate her mainstream success.\nPerformance in all its forms has always been intrinsic in Ayesha’s life, from adolescence - learning drums and piano - through to her breakout in Netflix’s recent Heartbreak High, which reached #5 in Netflix&#39;s top TV shows globally. For the rising creative, music and songwriting remained at the forefront of her creative output as she strives for humility and grit in all aspects of her craft. Pushing past the character that’s brought her worldwide recognition, Ayesha strives to stay grounded in all aspects of her craft. A deep consideration for authentic storytelling and humility is how Madon continues to captivate in whatever medium she harnesses. Her ability to consistently keep it real backed with a desire to build an honest legacy is how Ayesha Madon’s incumbent trajectory grows evermore resonant.",

        "biography": "Formed in 2009, Imagine Dragons first revealed their emotionally charged and inventive sensibilities with a series of independently released EPs that earned them grassroots following. Signed to KIDinaKORNER/Interscope by hitmaking producer Alex Da Kid, the band greatly expanded their fanbase with the release of their multi-platinum breakthrough single “It’s Time” (featured on the 2012 EP Continued Silence). With their past hits also including “Radioactive” (a diamond-selling smash that won Best Rock Performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards), Imagine Dragons went on to see Smoke + Mirrors debut at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart upon its release in early 2015.\n\nFor Imagine Dragons, one of the greatest achievements of Evolve is its unfettered honesty. “Instead of hiding behind metaphors, I was able to be more direct in my lyrics,” says Reynolds. “I really focused on searching deeper for lyrical value.” Along with giving the album untold emotional depth, honesty cuts through everyday chaos to reveal a luminous truth. “Right now the world can seem like a very dark and daunting place,” says Reynolds. “We wanted to create something like a lot of the records we grew up on, where it feels like you’re escaping into a world that’s much more vibrant. Our hope is that the album helps people focus on the beauty of each moment, and really see all the brilliance and color of life.”",

        "biography": "Australian indie folk singer/songwriter Vance Joy began his career playing the Melbourne open-mike scene at the end of the 2000s while completing his law degree. Finding success with his intimate Bon Iver-influenced songs, Joy decided to put law on hold and pursue a music career instead. Born James Keogh, the singer took the name Vance Joy from a character in Peter Carey&#39;s novel Bliss in order to better separate his personal and professional life. As his reputation grew, he began working with a manager, booking bigger shows around town and eventually recording his debut EP God Loves You When You&#39;re Dancing. His catchy folk-pop single &#34;Riptide&#34; was an immediate success in Australia and eventually led him to sign with Atlantic Records. In 2013, Joy began touring internationally and recording his first album for Atlantic. His debut Dream Your Life Away arrived in September 2014, spawning further hits Mess is Mine, Georgia and Fire and the Flood. His second album &#39;Nation of Two&#39; was released in February 2018 featuring singles Lay It On Me, Saturday Sun and We&#39;re Going Home. 2021 brought new music for Vance Joy with &#39;Missing Piece&#39;, now x2 Platinum in Australia, the track is taken off his 2022 album, &#39;In Our Own Sweet Time&#39; out now. www.vancejoy.com",

        "biography": "Bay Area rapper 24kGoldn delivers melodic flows inspired by a love of both high-end fashion and his music-industry lifestyle. He achieved platinum success before his 18th birthday, thanks to the viral success of his 2019 single \"Valentino.\" He rose quickly from posting his songs online to a major-label deal, bringing a passionate rap/singing hybrid style and ample amounts of pop accessibility to the chart-topping 2020 single \"Mood\" and releases like his gold-certified 2021 debut studio album, El Dorado. His second EP, Growing Pains, appeared in 2024.\r\n\n24kGoldn was born Golden Landis Von Jones in 2000. Growing up in a lively neighborhood in the Bay Area, he was exposed to different cultural perspectives early on, which would later inform his versatile approach to music. He began singing, but during his formative years he was more interested in fashion and sneakers than music. When he started rapping at age 14, his musical persona took shape quickly. By 2016, he had begun posting songs online, and early singles like \"iPhone\" and \"Trapper's Anthem\" attracted moderate attention. He steadily released new songs, and it was 2018's \"Ballin' Like Shareef\" that broke through to wider audiences. At this point, 24kGoldn was attending University of Southern California and signed to <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Columbia%22\">Columbia</a> affiliate Records LLC while working toward his degree. From there, he recorded several songs that would become viral hits, beginning with the danceable and hooky \"Valentino\" in late 2018 and continuing in 2019 with \"Games on Your Phone\" and \"A Lot to Lose.\" \r\n\n24kGoldn's first EP, Dropped Outta College, was released in November 2019 and charted in the Billboard 200. The song \"Mood\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:6ASri4ePR7RlsvIQgWPJpS\">Iann Dior</a> arrived in July 2020 and topped the Billboard Hot 100. The track reached the number one position in multiple countries and was popular enough to merit a remix featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:1uNFoZAHBGtllmzznpCI3s\">Justin Bieber</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1vyhD5VmyZ7KMfW5gqLgo5\">J Balvin</a>. His debut studio album, El Dorado, arrived in March 2021 and featured appearances from <a href=\"spotify:artist:1RyvyyTE3xzB2ZywiAwp0i\">Future</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4r63FhuTkUYltbVAg5TQnk\">DaBaby</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1zNqQNIdeOUZHb8zbZRFMX\">Swae Lee</a>. It was a significant success for 24kGoldn, reaching number 24 on the Billboard 200 and, rather appropriately, going gold. He returned later in the year with the single \"Prada\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:4Ga1P7PMIsmqEZqhYZQgDo\">Lil Tecca</a>. In 2022, 24kGoldn released the singles \"In My Head\" (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4exLIFE8sISLr28sqG1qNX\">Travis Barker</a>) and \"Overthinking\" (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1MIVXf74SZHmTIp4V4paH4\">Mabel</a>). After a deluxe edition of El Dorado was issued, he released \"Mistakes\" and \"Checkers\" (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2SyMN1PdSuQpZgrYXrkai1\">Bandmanrill</a>). \"Bite\" and \"My City\" (with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3oSJ7TBVCWMDMiYjXNiCKE\">Kane Brown</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5QdEbQJ3ylBnc3gsIASAT5\">G Herbo</a>, from the Fast X soundtrack) appeared in 2023. The EP Growing Pains was released in 2024, with an appearance by <a href=\"spotify:artist:0DtXHIvJ8NWBg5pGvsgWnR\">Leikeli47</a>. ~ Fred Thomas, Rovi",

        "biography": "Drummer/vocalist Nick Rattigan and guitarist/vocalist Jacob Rubeck first met at the age of 13 in a Las Vegas middle school, making their inauspicious start as Buffalo 66. As to be expected from a couple of kids who name their first band after a Vincent Gallo film, they didn’t find many peers growing up. Inspired by a Brady Bunch episode and the beachy, lo-fi rock that was then sweeping indie culture, the duo eventually changed their name to Surf Curse after moving to Reno, where Rattigan attended college at the University of Nevada and Rubeck washed dishes in senior citizen facilities. Traveling back and forth to LA for gigs, the band built their reputation on hooky songs that lived by the adage of “write what you know” — heartbreak, disillusionment and movies.\n\nOver the next decade, Rattigan and Rubeck expanded their artistic reach — Rattigan’s long-running Current Joys project released Voyager on indie rock powerhouse Secretly Canadian earlier this year, while Rubeck has explored his muse in Gap Girls and Casino Hearts. Meanwhile, Surf Curse continued to build their following over the span of three albums, most recently 2019’s Heaven Surrounds You, a lush and confident record produced by Jarvis Taveniere of Woods.",

        "biography": "In September 2013, when Irish solo artist Andrew Hozier-Byrne released his debut single - a song called ‘Take Me To Church’ - which he had mostly recorded in the attic of his parent’s house in Wicklow (his father a blues musician, his mother an artist), little did he know about the hurricane-strength surge in public interest that the song would spark, carrying him to international stardom.\n\n10 years and billions of streams later, Hozier still calls Wicklow home. While his music takes him all over the world, it is Ireland, its people and places, the weather and landscape that calls him back to where he feels he naturally belongs.\n\nThe much anticipated follow up to Hozier’s debut album, ‘Wasteland, Baby!’ was released to massive critical acclaim in 2019, entering the Billboard Top 200 Chart at #1.\n2023 was a big year for Hozier, as his debut single Take Me To Church was the 30th song ever to reach 1 billion streams. He released his third album ‘Unreal Unearth’, which charted #1 in the UK, Ireland, and Top 5 in the US, Netherlands, Germany &amp; New Zealand.\n\nThe last decade has brought both public and critical acclaim. Multi-platinum album sales, number one records, multiple awards including a Grammy-nomination, film and video game soundtracks and countless sold-out live shows all over the world. But as Hozier prepares for 2024, his passion for his art is undimmed, and his curiosity about our world - and all that is good and bad about it - remains undiminished.",

        "biography": "Perennial is an art project: Mod pop, post-hardcore, 60s soul, ambient electronic music, midcentury design, abstract expressionism, French New Wave cinema; it’s all collage material for Perennial.\n\nThe band — electric organist Chelsey Hahn, guitarist Chad Jewett and drummer Ceej Dioguardi — is equal parts manic basement show bombast and studio-as-instrument headphone listening. To see the New England three-piece in person is to experience a 20-minute burst of kinetic energy: dynamic, reckless, electrifying. To put on one of Perennial’s records is to spend almost the same amount of time with impeccably layered studio-as-instrument punk modernism.\n\nArt History, the band’s newest full-length album (out June 7 via Ernest Jenning Record Co.), finds Perennial further experimenting with their angular cut-and-glue aesthetic. An adventurous 20 minutes of impressionist punk energy, British Invasion guitar pop chic, and Mod-inflected rhythm and noise rave-ups, Art History is both Perennial’s most giddily accessible and most artistically daring record to date. \n\nhttps://perennialtheband.bandcamp.com/",

        "biography": "South Korean singer, songwriter, and actress Lee Ji-eun performs on the sweeter side of the K-pop spectrum, often focused on ballads and light pop. Choosing the stage name IU -- derived from \"I\" and \"you\" to symbolize unity -- Lee debuted in the late 2000s with early efforts Lost & Found and IU...IM, but had her breakthrough in 2010 with the chart-topping \"Good Day\" from her third EP, Real. She remained a fixture at the top of the Korean charts into the 2020s with hits such as 2011's Last Fantasy, 2019's Love Poem, and 2021's platinum-certified Lilac. In addition to her success in Korea, she also branched out into the Japanese market and, in 2020, scored her first number one in the U.S. with \"Eight.\"\r\n\nBorn in Seoul, she began her journey in the entertainment industry at a very young age, enrolling in acting classes while still in elementary school. By middle school, she'd developed a love for singing and trained with Good Entertainment (<a href=\"spotify:artist:0jVvkFPa6YbFXQ3Qmhita0\">Shinhwa</a>) before signing with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22LOEN+Entertainment%22\">LOEN Entertainment</a> in 2007. With a girl-next-door image, Lee made her 2008 debut with the Lost & Found EP, which featured the single \"Lost Child.\" The following year, Lee issued her first full-length, Growing Up, which featured the dance-oriented single \"Boo.\" Months later, the EP IU...IM arrived, including the effervescent singles \"Love Attack\" and \"Marshmallow.\" \r\n\nIt wasn't until the end of 2010 and her third EP, Real, that the singer experienced her commercial breakthrough. Her highest-charting effort to date, Real debuted a more mature sound for the singer. Featuring the \"Good Day\" single, it was quickly followed by the three-song expansion single Real+. Her sophomore set, Last Fantasy, was issued in 2011. Her highest-selling album, it was also her first chart-topper in Korea, and the track \"You and I\" spent five weeks atop the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100. Eventually, Last Fantasy would win Record of the Year at the Seoul Music Awards and become the 15th best-selling Korean album of the year. Following the success of Fantasy, Lee inked a deal with <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22EMI+Music+Japan%22\">EMI Music Japan</a>, which broke her into the Japanese market in 2013 with the Can You Hear Me? EP, which was her first Japanese-language effort. Recorded in Japan, Korea, China, and the United States, the five-song collection also featured production by <a href=\"spotify:artist:4ZaXj4ZrqscgpfqJolMfib\">Jimmy Jam</a> and Terry Lewis. That same year, Lee released her third LP, Modern Times, which continued her sonic maturity with hints of jazz and bossa nova. \r\n\nIn 2014, her sixth EP, A Flower Bookmark, was released. The collection comprised covers of popular Korean pop songs from the '80s and '90s, like Kim Wan-sun's 1990 song \"Pierrot Smiles at Us\" and Jo Deok-bae's 1985 \"My Old Story.\" That summer, Lee made her first American concert appearance at KCON in Los Angeles. By 2015, she'd made her debut as sole lyricist and producer on her seventh EP, Chat-Shire, which peaked at number four on the Billboard World Albums chart. As her acting roles continued to maintain her visibility throughout East Asia, Lee issued her fourth LP, the critically acclaimed Palette, in 2017. Debuting atop the Korean Gaon chart and the Billboard World Albums chart, Palette featured <a href=\"spotify:artist:4Kxlr1PRlDKEB0ekOCyHgX\">Big Bang</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:30b9WulBM8sFuBo17nNq9c\">G-Dragon</a> on the title track. A sequel EP, A Flower Bookmark 2, landed later that year.\r\n\nIU spent 2018 playing a prominent role on the television show My Mister. She also celebrated the tenth anniversary of her debut by issuing the single \"Bbibbi.\" She continued acting into 2019 with Persona and Hotel del Luna while also releasing her ninth EP, the chart-topping Love Poem, that November. 2020 saw the arrival of the Suga-produced single \"Eight,\" which became her first U.S. number one. In March 2021, she returned with her fifth full-length album, Lilac. Buoyed by the single \"Celebrity,\" the album topped the South Korean charts and was certified platinum. ~ Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi",

        "biography": "Khoi Vu is a young Vietnamese singer/songwriter and music producer. Hails from the capital city Hanoi, he&#39;s currently pursuing studies at SOPA (School of Popular Arts), one of the prestigious art universities in Berlin, Germany. During his promising career, Khoi Vu has gained recognition through countless heartfelt songs such as &#34;Berlin&#34; , &#34;Tìm Tôi&#34; (Find Me), &#34;Hông về tình iu&#34; (Not About Love) and &#34;Ái Nộ&#34; in collaboration with producer Masew. These songs have captured the attention of a large audience and have garnered millions of views. With his talent, he effortlessly takes on various roles in music production, songwriting, and singing.\n\nKhoi Vu believes that his musical journey began serendipitously, thanks to a birthday gift from his father—a guitar, which became his first musical instrument. Little did he know, that very guitar ignited a passion for music within him, although he never envisioned pursuing a professional singing career. After graduating from high school, Vu initially pursued studies in architecture in Germany, but his passion for music remained ever-present and burning. Eventually, he devoted his time and creativity entirely to music.\n\nLooking ahead, Khoi Vu plans to embark on exciting collaborations and is set to release his solo EP in 2023, showcasing a relatively new music style in the Vpop market and aiming for international recognition.\n\nContact Khoi Vu: khoivupham99&#64;gmail.com",

Early in 1999, drummer Peter Jensen left the band, and was replaced by Laust Sonne.\n\nEarlier this year, D-A-D turned 40 years and turned into a museum exhibition. But this is by no means the end of everything. The quartet is brimming with energy, and they have written 40 songs since their last album, &#34;A Prayer for the Loud&#34;, that was released in 2019. Out of these songs, the four artists have selected 14 of the best ones for their new double album &#34;Speed of Darkness&#34; that will be out on October 4. \n\nThe new year started with a trip back in time for D-A-D with their anniversary, and now they look into the future with their 13th album, and the first signs point to a remarkably strong collection of songs.\n\nSome would call this a clear understatement; the four artists have not been in so much agreement about the quality of new songs for an upcoming album in many years as they are today.  Jesper Binzer adds: ”I am totally stoked about this new collection of songs – I can’t wait for the fans to hear this album. It is so much D-A-D – and so much better!”",

The aggressive glammy guitar snaps and bites as it spirals around a thunderous, hard-rocking rhythm section that pulsates with an aura of glamour and charisma but also an overriding heaviness. They&#39;re seizing a moment, and all of this is driven by their high-intensity moshpit-inducing live shows. They’ve captured lightning in a bottle and are selling out clubs across France.\n\nIt&#39;s music built for stadiums but made to connect with people. It blends the infectiousness of Nothing But Thieves, the captivating driving force of Royal Blood, and the melodic ambition of Muse. \n\nLight and dark, euphoria and heaviness, glamour and aggression - Storm Orchestra are here to be your new favourite band.",

        "biography": "Hailed as the <a href=\"spotify:artist:74ASZWbe4lXaubB36ztrGX\">Bob Dylan</a> of Japan, singer/songwriter Yosui Inoue has spent the better part of three and a half decades touching upon nearly every musical style to hit Japan, with Inoue himself often at the forefront. Prior to a professional career, Inoue got his start in enka singing. Upon hearing <a href=\"spotify:artist:3WrFJ7ztbogyGnTHbHJFl2\">the Beatles</a>, however, he learned the guitar and moved toward new Western-influenced styles. After a brief turn under the pseudonym Andre Madore helped to launch his fame in 1969, Inoue returned to his own name and released his first album, Rupture, in 1972 to wide acclaim. At the head of the folk movement in Japan, Inoue found himself the premier exponent of the singer/songwriter style, handily outselling artists in all genres in the nation. His sophomore album, 1973's Ice World, stayed on the Oricon charts for a full two years, returning to the number one slot repeatedly in the earlier months of its release. With such wild success, Inoue formed his own label, For Life, and continued releasing albums each year. Success rarely came at the same level as it did for Ice World, but Inoue's popularity and sales remained high for decades to come (selling over 20 million albums cumulatively), as he explored contemporary style elements as well as additional idols (also taking up the dual guitar and harmonica, helping to cement comparisons to <a href=\"spotify:artist:74ASZWbe4lXaubB36ztrGX\">Dylan</a>). Album after album followed, critically culminating with 1982's Lion & Pelican. In the mid-'90s, Inoue took a hiatus from performing and recording (though short-lived) in order to focus on production, collaborating with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3ZWE1TnryM03rfzVin17K0\">Tamio Okuda</a> (formerly of <a href=\"spotify:artist:0z4FY376uhecutd5Adph8s\">Unicorn</a>) to develop the duo Puffy AmiYumi, among other projects. Though Inoue still tours and records new material, compilations have been released in large amounts since 2000, and continue to make waves on the Oricon charts. Released in 2008, Yosui Inoue Box found its way to the Oricon Top Ten, despite being a 20-disc, $400 behemoth. ~ Adam Greenberg, Rovi",

        "biography": "Francis Lai, The Aristocrat of Melody\nWhether referring to the man or to his music, the same words spring to the lips of Francis Lai’s friends: simplicity, discretion, warmth. It is therefore universally acknowledged: Francis Lai resembles his music. \nBest remembered for his Oscar-winning scores to « A Man and a Woman » &amp; «Love Story », composer Francis Lai was born April 26, 1932, in Nice, France. He started his career as accordionist of Edith Piaf, for whom Lai composed many songs. He made his film debut in 66 with  Claude Lelouch&#39;s  movie « A Man and a Woman » that elevated Lai to international renown. He won a Oscar for the 1970 blockbuster « Love Story ».The film&#39;s theme, &#34;Where Do I Begin?,&#34; also became a Top 40 hit. Ambassador of a certain ‘French’ romanticism, Francis Lai died on November 7th, 2018 at the age of 86. He worked unpretentiously in the world of song (with Elton John, Mireille Mathieu, Edith Piaf...) and cinema, always unaffected by trends and the media. His impressive track record of honours and awards is cause for reflection on the career of a melody writer with an exceptional instinct, whose talent has found worldwide acclaim, from the hills of Nice (France) to those of Hollywood.\n Now available the ultimate and official tribute show FRANCIS LAI STORY, See it on official Youtube channel (francis lai love story official) or listen to it on Spotify!\nAbout concert Francis Lai Orchestra will be in Japan next october 2023 for 5 gigs!\nwww.francislai.com",

        "biography": "Bread was one of the most popular pop groups of the early 1970s, earning a string of well-crafted, melodic soft rock singles, all of which were written by keyboardist/vocalist <a href=\"spotify:artist:5BmXbfqAgfkuTkPlVQDKOW\">David Gates</a>. A session musician and producer, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5BmXbfqAgfkuTkPlVQDKOW\">Gates</a> met in 1968 guitarist/vocalist James Griffin, who had already released a solo album called Summer Holiday. Griffin hired <a href=\"spotify:artist:5BmXbfqAgfkuTkPlVQDKOW\">Gates</a> to produce a new album, and the pair soon became a group, adding guitarist/vocalist Robb Royer from the band Pleasure Fair, whom <a href=\"spotify:artist:5BmXbfqAgfkuTkPlVQDKOW\">Gates</a> had produced early in their career. The trio soon signed with Elektra Records, becoming one of the label's first pop bands. Naming themselves Bread, the group released their self-titled debut album in late 1968. Although it was filled with accessible, melodic soft rock that became the band's signature sound, the record had no hit singles.\r\n\nWith their second album, On the Waters, Bread established themselves as hitmakers. \"Make It with You,\" the first single released from the album, became a number one hit, which led to \"It Don't Matter to Me,\" a song taken from Bread, becoming a Top Ten hit. With On the Waters becoming a gold record, the group embarked on a tour, adding a full-time drummer, Mike Botts, to the lineup. Manna, released in the spring of 1971, wasn't as big a hit as the previous record, yet it launched another Top Ten single with \"If.\" Royer left the group after the album and was replaced by Larry Knechtel, a Los Angeles session musician who played on records by <a href=\"spotify:artist:1PCZpxHJz7WAMF8EEq8bfc\">the Byrds</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3oDbviiivRWhXwIE8hxkVV\">the Beach Boys</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:320EPCSEezHt1rtbfwH6Ck\">the Monkees</a>, among others. The new lineup released its first single, \"Mother Freedom,\" in mid-1971; the song scraped the Top 40 at number 37. Bread's next single, \"Baby I'm-a Want You,\" became a number three hit at the end of the year. After \"Everything I Own\" reached number five in January of 1972, an album called Baby I'm-a Want You was released. Peaking at number three, the record became the group's most successful album. The group's fifth album, Guitar Man, followed in October 1972.\r\n\nAt the beginning of 1973, Bread disbanded after a dispute between <a href=\"spotify:artist:5BmXbfqAgfkuTkPlVQDKOW\">Gates</a> and Griffin. Griffin claimed that, when the group was conceived, the pair agreed that the singles would be divided equally between the two songwriters; <a href=\"spotify:artist:5BmXbfqAgfkuTkPlVQDKOW\">Gates</a> wrote most of Bread's hits and wanted to continue to compose the singles. The two parted ways, with each of the musicians pursuing solo careers. Bread reunited in 1976, releasing Lost Without Your Love in early 1977. The title track became their last Top Ten hit, peaking at number nine. The success could not keep the group together as tensions between <a href=\"spotify:artist:5BmXbfqAgfkuTkPlVQDKOW\">Gates</a> and Griffin began to escalate again. After Griffin split from the group, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5BmXbfqAgfkuTkPlVQDKOW\">Gates</a> assembled a new version of the band and toured under the name Bread. Griffin sued <a href=\"spotify:artist:5BmXbfqAgfkuTkPlVQDKOW\">Gates</a> for using the name, which the duo co-owned. A judge ordered the group not to perform, record, or collect royalty payments until the case was resolved; it wasn't resolved until 1984.

However, his career declined in the '80s, and by the '90s, he was running a California ranch.

        "biography": "The Gloss is the second album from Cola. From their inception Cola have expanded on the d.i.y. ethic of the Dischord and SST eras, creating potent sounds from a minimal palette of drums/bass/guitar and lacing their songs with winsome one-liners and societal commentary. What’s another word for commentary? Gloss, apparently. Never basic, the lyrics reward repeated listening for deeper meanings. David Berman’s poetry-via-garage light pennings are an inspiration, as equally so are the lighter side of UK first-wave New Wave and the Dunedin sound. The results are in the pudding: at times sparse and poetic, at others a thrilling, hook-laden good time, as with the cheeky romantic sketch of a one-night stand that is so overflowing with innuendo-cum-journalism talk that it almost teeters over into self-parody. But the results are the right combination of lightheartedness and sincerity. Romanticism is never far from laughter, and equally never far from righteous anger in the music of Cola: “Pulling quotes now in the dark/Our outlook is restrained/Your tongue might weaken to be-fit your smile/Til nothing ill remains.” ‘nuff said. It&#39;s an album bursting with energy and wit and ideas–filled to the margins. Out June 14th 2024 on Fire Talk.",

        "biography": "Leo Sayer (born Gerard Sayer) had a string of highly polished mainstream pop hits in the late '70s. Sayer began his musical career as the leader of the London-based Terraplane Blues Band in the late '60s. He formed Patches with drummer <a href=\"spotify:artist:0RFrsBREf9hotr9zNeIoPD\">Dave Courtney</a> in 1971; <a href=\"spotify:artist:0RFrsBREf9hotr9zNeIoPD\">Courtney</a> had previously played with British pop star <a href=\"spotify:artist:284fAcjDaBYlPBLZnQkZU0\">Adam Faith</a>. <a href=\"spotify:artist:284fAcjDaBYlPBLZnQkZU0\">Faith</a> was starting a management career in the early '70s, so <a href=\"spotify:artist:0RFrsBREf9hotr9zNeIoPD\">Courtney</a> brought Patches to his former employer in hopes of securing a contract. Patches failed to impress <a href=\"spotify:artist:284fAcjDaBYlPBLZnQkZU0\">Faith</a>, yet he liked Sayer and chose to promote him as a solo artist. Sayer began recording some solo material written with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0RFrsBREf9hotr9zNeIoPD\">David Courtney</a> at <a href=\"spotify:artist:5odf7hjI7hyvAw66tmxhGF\">Roger Daltrey</a>'s studio; <a href=\"spotify:artist:67ea9eGLXYMsO2eYQRui3w\">the Who</a>'s lead singer liked the Sayer/<a href=\"spotify:artist:0RFrsBREf9hotr9zNeIoPD\">Courtney</a> originals enough to record a handful himself, including the hit \"Giving It All Away.\" Sayer's debut single, \"Why Is Everybody Going Home,\" failed to have an impact, yet 1973's \"The Show Must Go On\" hit number one in the U.K.; a cover by <a href=\"spotify:artist:4FAEZeJcsYYBkNq2D3KGTV\">Three Dog Night</a> stopped Sayer's version from charting in the U.S. The following year he released his first album, Silver Bird, followed quickly by Just a Boy, which included two more British hit singles, \"One Man Band\" and \"Long Tall Glasses (I Can Dance)\"; \"Long Tall Glasses\" managed to break Sayer into the American Top Ten in early 1975. Sayer's working relationship with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0RFrsBREf9hotr9zNeIoPD\">Courtney</a> was severed during the recording of his third album, Another Year (1975). In 1976, he released Endless Flight, which was co-written with former <a href=\"spotify:artist:3JsMj0DEzyWc0VDlHuy9Bx\">Supertramp</a> member Frank Farrell; featuring the number one singles \"You Make Me Feel like Dancing\" and \"When I Need You,\" the record became his biggest hit in both the U.S. and the U.K., selling over a million copies in America. Following Endless Flight, Sayer became a fixture in the American Top 40, yet his hits began to dry up in England.\r\n\nSayer began the '80s with the American number two hit \"More Than I Can Say,\" but it was his last big single in the U.S. His last chart entry in America was the early 1981 hit \"Living in a Fantasy\"; the U.K. hits didn't stop until 1983, after \"Til You Come Back to Me\" scraped the charts. After lying low for the rest of the decade, he attempted a comeback in 1990 with Cool Touch but it fell on deaf ears. \r\n\nSayer spent much of the '90s entangled in lawsuits, but he re-emerged as a touring act toward the end of the decade. The 1999 album Live in London captures this effort. Sayer's real comeback arrived in 2006, when <a href=\"spotify:artist:6CisEcpNg7X1sXXhLoMIp4\">DJ Meck</a> remixed \"Thunder in My Heart\" -- it became a smash, reaching number one on the U.K. charts. This sparked a Sayer revival that was accompanied by hits compilations and an appearance on Celebrity Big Brother in 2007. \r\n\nSayer emigrated to Australia in 2005, becoming a full citizen in 2009. His new home saw the release of Don't Wait Until Tomorrow in 2008 -- it was the only country where the record was released -- and he worked in Australian film ads and television, while also touring regularly. Restless Years, a collection of new material, appeared in 2015, followed by Selfie in 2019. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi",

        "biography": "GRAMMY-nominated &amp; multi-platinum singer/songwriter Shawn Mendes has released 4 acclaimed studio albums, with his 5th studio album Shawn out now. The new album draws deeply from his travels and experiences over the last few years, following the cancellation of his 2022 tour. Representing his most musically intimate and lyrically honest work to date, Shawn guides listeners through a profound self-dialogue with each song.\n \nIn 2018 Shawn released his self-titled platinum album, which was also nominated in two categories for the 61st annual GRAMMY® Awards, including “Song of the Year” for “In My Blood” and “Best Pop Vocal Album” for SHAWN MENDES. The same year Shawn debuted his 3x platinum single, “If I Can’t Have You.” Following the GRAMMY nominated album, Shawn’s 2020 album, Wonder, debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming Shawn&#39;s fourth consecutive US number-one album (the youngest male artist to achieve that feat at the time). In 2019, Shawn was nominated for a GRAMMY for “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance” for “Señorita,” his hit single with Camila Cabello. With “Señorita” at #1 and “If I Can’t Have You” at #2, Shawn is the first male solo artist ever to simultaneously hold the #1 and #2 places on the Top 40 chart. Shawn broke onto the scene in April of 2017 with his 6x platinum hit “There’s Nothing Holdin’ Me Back.” The track scored Shawn his second #1 single at Top 40 radio and on Billboard’s Pop Songs chart, joining his 8x platinum single “Stitches.”",

        "biography": "Colombia's Karol G is a best-selling, chart-topping, award-winning vocalist known for her soulful mix of reggaeton, pop, and dance-oriented R&B. Her many collaborative singles appearances with other urbano stars -- including <a href=\"spotify:artist:1SupJlEpv7RS2tPNRaHViT\">Nicky Jam</a>, Anuel AA, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4q3ewBCX7sLwd24euuV69X\">Bad Bunny</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1vyhD5VmyZ7KMfW5gqLgo5\">J Balvin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1r4hJ1h58CWwUQe3MxPuau\">Maluma</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:0TnOYISbd1XYRBk9myaseg\">Pitbull</a> -- regularly placed inside the Top 100, while their accompanying videos garnered hundreds of millions of views. Though she issued her first single at 16 in 2007, she struggled for the next decade to establish herself in reggaeton because it was a male-dominated genre. It took ten years, more than a billion YouTube views, and hundreds of millions of music streams before she could release her debut LP, Unstoppable, in 2017. Two years later, her profile rose to the level of a bona fide star thanks to chart-topping singles such as \"Tusa\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a>, \"China\" with Anuel AA, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4VMYDCV2IEDYJArk749S6m\">Daddy Yankee</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1i8SpTcr7yvPOmcqrbnVXY\">Ozuna</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1vyhD5VmyZ7KMfW5gqLgo5\">J Balvin</a>, and \"Ocean,\" the title track from her number 22 sophomore long-player. In 2020 Karol G was a nearly constant presence on the charts with many collaborations -- including \"Enjoy Yourself\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0eDvMgVFoNV3TpwtrVCoTj\">Pop Smoke</a> and \"Follow\" with Anuel AA -- and solo singles such as \"Ay, Dios Mío!\" and \"Bichota.\" In March 2021, she issued her third long-player, the chart-topping KG0516. Her fourth set, 2023's Mañana Será Bonito, took her to even greater heights, winning multiple Grammys into 2024.\r\n\nBorn Carolina Giraldo Rivera in Medellín, Colombia, in 1991, Karol G was interested in music from a young age, influenced by her father, a working musician. After high school, she studied music at the University of Antioquia. Her first break came in 2010 when she competed on Colombia's version of The X Factor, El Factor X. Two years later, her profile was raised even higher after duetting with Colombian reggaeton singer <a href=\"spotify:artist:3PAwspMN27PDm81WwXDsMf\">Reykon</a> on the single \"301.\" In 2013, Karol G released her first solo single, \"Amor de Dos,\" featuring <a href=\"spotify:artist:1SupJlEpv7RS2tPNRaHViT\">Nicky Jam</a>. Several more well-received singles followed including \"Ricos Besos,\" \"Manyana,\" and \"Ya No Te Creo.\" In 2016, she delivered the Daniel Echavarria-produced single \"Casi Nada.\" The following year, \"Ahora Me Llama,\" a collaborative single with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4q3ewBCX7sLwd24euuV69X\">Bad Bunny</a>, became a hit. It was featured on her debut full-length, Unstoppable, which was released in October 2017, and peaked at number two on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart.\r\n\nShe returned in early 2018 with the saucy single \"Mi Cama.\" Another track, \"Punto G,\" followed in 2019 and took home the year's award for Best Song at the Premio ASCAP ceremony and was nominated for three Billboard Latin Music Awards. In April 2020, Karol G and Anuel AA released the collaborative single and video \"Follow.\" Recorded while the pair quarantined in Miami, the video rang up 20 million views in its first four days. Another song, \"Ay, Dios Mío!,\" arrived in July 2020 and reached number five on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart, while its video garnered more than 400 million views. She also collaborated with <a href=\"spotify:artist:7gOdHgIoIKoe4i9Tta6qdD\">the Jonas Brothers</a> on the track \"X,\" which debuted during the closing credits of the group's documentary film Happiness Continues. Karol G and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7gOdHgIoIKoe4i9Tta6qdD\">the Jonas Brothers</a> filmed the music video on their individual iPhones, then combined the footage to offer an innovative approach to music making videos during the pandemic. \r\n\nLater that year, she joined <a href=\"spotify:artist:0eDvMgVFoNV3TpwtrVCoTj\">Pop Smoke</a> to collaborate on his Top 40 hit \"Enjoy Yourself.\" Her single \"Ay, Dios Mío!\" charted in more than a dozen countries though not in the U.S. Its music video, however, registered more than 400 million views. She collaborated with <a href=\"spotify:artist:1i8SpTcr7yvPOmcqrbnVXY\">Ozuna</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:7iK8PXO48WeuP03g8YR51W\">Myke Towers</a> on the number three \"Carmelo,\" and in December released the anthemic \"Bichota.\" It, too, peaked at number three on the Hot Latin Songs chart, while its video registered nearly 700 million views.\r\n\nOn February 2, 2021, just 16 days before her 30th birthday on Valentine's Day, Karol G released \"Location\" featuring Anuel AA and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1vyhD5VmyZ7KMfW5gqLgo5\">J Balvin</a>. Its video rang up more than 130 million views during its first month of release, while it reached number five at Latin Songs. Her third album, the Grammy-nominated KG0516 (titled for the date she signed her first record deal) was released in late March. The 16-track set was co-produced with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3m5qlPf2OkihLz3dRYnkPA\">Ovy on the Drums</a>. While it included her Latin Grammy-nominated \"Tusa\" with <a href=\"spotify:artist:0hCNtLu0JehylgoiP8L4Gh\">Nicki Minaj</a>, as well as most of the singles from the previous year, much of the record included new music comprised of six solo performances and ten collaborations with artists including <a href=\"spotify:artist:0KKUc4amZyvswV2YL6WTar\">Mariah Angeliq</a> (\"El Makinon\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:1i8SpTcr7yvPOmcqrbnVXY\">Ozuna</a> (\"Odisea\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:3VHAySZQPlfGlNLslzXYpN\">Nathy Peluso</a> (\"Gato Malo\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:3ptY5WTxu77JpAQQnHyxEl\">Yandar & Yostin</a> (\"Sola Es Mejor\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3ipn9JLAPI5GUEo4y4jcoi\">Ludacris</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4ArPQ1Opcksbbf3CPwEjWE\">Emilee</a> (\"Beautiful Boy\"). With KG0516, Karol G became the first female Latin artist to deliver a Spanish-language album that simultaneously entered the Global streaming and Top Latin Albums industry charts at number one. The video for \"El Makinon\" registered 28 million views in three days. \r\n\nKarol G's success continued in 2022, first with the <a href=\"spotify:artist:4obzFoKoKRHIphyHzJ35G3\">Becky G</a> collaboration \"Mamiii,\" and then with her own track \"Provenza,\" both of which hit number one on multiple charts. Further collaborations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:4IndUOBCZYZg61557iq2A9\">Maldy</a> (\"Gatúbela\"), <a href=\"spotify:artist:5lwmRuXgjX8xIwlnauTZIP\">Romeo Santos</a> (\"X Si Volvemos\"), and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3m5qlPf2OkihLz3dRYnkPA\">Ovy on the Drums</a> (\"Cairo\") preceded her fourth LP, Mañana Será Bonito, which arrived in February 2023. It went on to win Album of the Year at the Latin Grammys, and was followed later in the year by the club-friendly mixtape Mañana Será Bonito: Bichota Season. A year after its release, Mañana Será Bonito took home the Grammy for Best Música Urbana Album. By the end of 2024, Karol G had scored several more Top Ten Latin hits, including her <a href=\"spotify:artist:2o5jDhtHVPhrJdv3cEQ99Z\">Tiësto</a> collaboration \"Contigo\" and \"Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido,\" the latter of which hit number one in several countries and topped Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart. She also hit number four on the Latin chart with \"+57,\" her star-studded track with <a href=\"spotify:artist:2LRoIwlKmHjgvigdNGBHNo\">Feid</a>, DFZM, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3m5qlPf2OkihLz3dRYnkPA\">Ovy on the Drums</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1vyhD5VmyZ7KMfW5gqLgo5\">J Balvin</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1r4hJ1h58CWwUQe3MxPuau\">Maluma</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:7j6DKwmjbxvpQO8h914uEz\">Ryan Castro</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1TA5sGRlKUJXBN4ZyJuDIX\">Blessd</a>. ~ Matt Collar, Rovi",

        "biography": "A powerhouse singer, songwriter, producer, and dancer, Beyoncé is a multifaceted global superstar by any measure. The Houstonian rose to fame in the late '90s as the central member of pop-R&B group <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Y8cdNmUJH7yBTd9yOvr5i\">Destiny's Child</a>. The following decade, she started her ongoing streak of number one solo studio albums with Dangerously in Love (2003), the source of her first number one pop single, the ecstatic \"Crazy in Love.\" Nearly omnipresent hits such as the elegantly dismissive \"Irreplaceable\" (2006) and boisterous \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" (2008), combined with sold-out world tours and Grammy Awards, all heightened Beyoncé's profile in the 2000s. Billboard named her female artist of the decade, while the RIAA acknowledged that, with 64 gold and platinum certifications, she was its top-selling artist. Beyoncé continued to diversify in the 2010s with the visual albums Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), followed by the <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a> collaboration Everything Is Love (2018) and her work on the remake of The Lion King (2019). The latter project was expanded with the soundtrack The Lion King: The Gift, executive-produced by Beyoncé, who also wrote and directed the related musical film Black Is King (2020). Beyoncé has since become the most awarded artist in Grammy history with Renaissance (2022), a cosmopolitan dancefloor celebration tying together gospel, disco, house, bounce, and Afrobeats with nods to ballroom culture. The second act in that series, Cowboy Carter (2024), carried Beyoncé into the country music realm and topped the pop, country, and folk charts.\r\n\nBorn in Houston, Beyoncé Giselle Knowles began performing at age seven, winning over 30 local competitions for her dancing and vocal abilities. She joined her cousin <a href=\"spotify:artist:3AuMNF8rQAKOzjYppFNAoB\">Kelly Rowland</a> and classmates LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett in forming an adolescent vocal group. Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé's father and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3AuMNF8rQAKOzjYppFNAoB\">Rowland</a>'s legal guardian, signed on to be the girls' manager, eventually quitting his full-time job to focus on their efforts. This situation would ultimately lead to the creation of one of the most popular female R&B groups of all time: <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Y8cdNmUJH7yBTd9yOvr5i\">Destiny's Child</a>.\r\n\n<a href=\"spotify:artist:1Y8cdNmUJH7yBTd9yOvr5i\">Destiny's Child</a> gained momentum throughout the '90s. They appeared on Star Search in 1992 (under the name Girls Tyme) and weathered several lineup changes before signing to <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Columbia+%22\">Columbia </a>in 1997. Four studio albums later, the group had officially become the best-selling female group of all time, with such smash hits as \"Jumpin' Jumpin',\" \"Bills, Bills, Bills,\" \"Say My Name,\" and \"Survivor\" bolstering the young women's momentum despite lawsuits from former members Roberson and Luckett. In 2001, Beyoncé, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3AuMNF8rQAKOzjYppFNAoB\">Rowland</a>, and replacement member <a href=\"spotify:artist:6t7nbFAc2dUa7oNu7kBOui\">Michelle Williams</a> allowed themselves a break from the group to pursue individual solo careers. Before landing several movie roles, Beyoncé became the first Black female artist and second woman ever to win the annual ASCAP Pop Songwriter of the Year Award. An appearance in the MTV drama Carmen: A Hip Hopera quickly followed, but it was her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in 2002's Austin Powers in Goldmember that established her as a true Hollywood star. \r\n\nWhile \"Work It Out,\" her inclusion on the movie's soundtrack failed to chart in the U.S., it was a Top Ten hit in the U.K. Beyoncé's full-length solo debut, 2003's Dangerously in Love, reached multi-platinum status. Featuring collaborations with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3Isy6kedDrgPYoTS1dazA9\">Sean Paul</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2wIVse2owClT7go1WT98tk\">Missy Elliott</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1G9G7WwrXka3Z1r7aIDjI7\">OutKast</a>'s <a href=\"spotify:artist:2ht3wxeT69CzyKFChNnNAB\">Big Boi</a>, and romantic interest <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, the album spawned a total of four Top Ten singles and garnered the singer five Grammys. <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Y8cdNmUJH7yBTd9yOvr5i\">Destiny's Child</a> reconvened the following year to release Destiny Fulfilled; upon completing the resulting tour, the group issued one final album, a greatest-hits compilation entitled #1's, and subsequently disbanded. Beyoncé turned her full attention to her burgeoning solo career. She released B'day in September 2006 and, three months later, turned in an award-winning performance for the movie musical Dreamgirls. The singer then embarked on the Beyoncé Experience concert tour and released a live DVD in November 2007. \r\n\nThe following year proved to be another busy one as Beyoncé landed the role of <a href=\"spotify:artist:0iOVhN3tnSvgDbcg25JoJb\">Etta James</a> in Cadillac Records, a musical biopic that explored the heyday of Chicago's <a href=\"spotify:search:label%3A%22Chess%22\">Chess</a> label. Shooting commenced in February 2008, with Beyoncé also serving as co-executive producer. One month before the film's December release, the singer released her third studio album, I Am...Sasha Fierce. The double-disc effort emphasized her two distinct personalities, allowing Beyoncé to explore both mainstream sounds and traditional R&B. Some live releases followed. Released in 2009, I Am...Yours, a CD/DVD set, documented an August 2009 performance at Wynn Las Vegas, while 2010's I Am...World Tour, available in separate audio and video formats, was recorded at London's significantly larger O2 Arena (a few months after the Vegas program). She followed ten Grammy nominations with 2011's 4, which debuted at the top of the Billboard 200. One of her most energetic and empowering tracks, \"Run the World (Girls),\" was issued as the lead single, while \"Love on Top\" eventually won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance. \r\n\nGiving birth to Blue Ivy Carter in January 2012 didn't slow her down. Within a few months, she was performing in Atlantic City, and she later appeared at President <a href=\"spotify:artist:4FySKEW0F2fAmS8Jc5ClRv\">Barack Obama</a>'s second inauguration. Joined by <a href=\"spotify:artist:6t7nbFAc2dUa7oNu7kBOui\">Michelle Williams</a> and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3AuMNF8rQAKOzjYppFNAoB\">Kelly Rowland</a>, she headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show. Life Is But a Dream, a documentary, first aired on HBO in February 2013, and was followed by appearances on albums by <a href=\"spotify:artist:3AuMNF8rQAKOzjYppFNAoB\">Rowland</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:1W3FSF1BLpY3hlVIgvenLz\">the-Dream</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>. New material, such as \"Bow Down\" and \"Standing on the Sun,\" trickled out without proper releases. Then, on December 13 -- with no preceding announcement -- Beyoncé released a self-titled visual album (a full-length studio recording with an accompanying video for each song). Her husband and daughter, along with <a href=\"spotify:artist:3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4\">Drake</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2h93pZq0e7k5yf4dywlkpM\">Frank Ocean</a>, and writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (via a sampled TED talk), made guest appearances. Beyoncé, assisted by the likes of Hit-Boy, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5Y5TRrQiqgUO4S36tzjIRZ\">Timbaland</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:31TPClRtHm23RisEBtV3X7\">Justin Timberlake</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:360IAlyVv4PCEVjgyMZrxK\">Miguel</a>, co-wrote and co-produced the majority of the album's material. Like Beyoncé's four previous solo albums, it went to number one, and quickly went platinum in the U.S. Three months after she completed the Mrs. Carter Show world tour, she and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a> embarked on the On the Run Tour, which reached the U.S., Canada, and France from June through September 2014. The following February, she was nominated for six Grammy Awards and won three, including Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance, both for \"Drunk in Love.\" Although she didn't release any new material in 2015, she co-wrote and appeared on <a href=\"spotify:artist:1bT7m67vi78r2oqvxrP3X5\">Naughty Boy</a>'s Top Five U.K. pop hit \"Runnin' (Lose It All),\" and contributed vocals to <a href=\"spotify:artist:4gzpq5DPGxSnKTe4SA8HAU\">Coldplay</a>'s \"Hymn for the Weekend.\" \r\n\nIn February 2016, a new single, \"Formation,\" and its trenchant accompanying video, were released just before her Super Bowl 50 half-time performance. That April, another striking visual album, Lemonade, premiered on HBO, and its audio was subsequently available for streaming and download. Some of the album's specific, forthright lyrics fueled speculation about the status of Beyoncé and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>'s relationship. <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:4FZ3j1oH43e7cukCALsCwf\">Jack White</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:53KwLdlmrlCelAZMaLVZqU\">James Blake</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ\">the Weeknd</a> appeared as featured artists, while <a href=\"spotify:artist:2gpPCu8rjzdobGqDZJpHiR\">Just Blaze</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5TAipisjquAkq2o7lzMJyc\">Mike Dean</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:5fMUXHkw8R8eOP2RNVYEZX\">Diplo</a> were among the co-producers. The Formation World Tour began days later, just before the album became her sixth consecutive number one studio album. After wrapping that half-year trek, Coachella announced that Beyoncé would be headlining the festival's 2017 installment. While that performance was eventually canceled due to the birth of her twins, she would make a triumphant return to the desert stage a year later. Backed by a pyramid constructed with bleachers and over two-hundred backing performers, Beyoncé became the first Black female to headline the festival, closing both weekends of Coachella 2018 with historic performances that highlighted Black culture and featured guest appearances by <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2auiVi8sUZo17dLy1HwrTU\">Solange</a>, and a reunited <a href=\"spotify:artist:1Y8cdNmUJH7yBTd9yOvr5i\">Destiny's Child</a>.\r\n\nMonths later in June 2018, while Beyoncé and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>'s co-headlining On the Run II tour was underway, the couple released Everything Is Love, a collaborative full-length credited to <a href=\"spotify:artist:4fpTMHe34LC5t3h5ztK8qu\">the Carters</a>. Led by \"Apeshit,\" a single featuring input from <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell Williams</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:0VRj0yCOv2FXJNP47XQnx5\">Quavo</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4DdkRBBYG6Yk9Ka8tdJ9BW\">Offset</a>, the album narrowly missed the top spot on the Billboard 200. Wrapping at the end of the year, On the Run II was the third-highest grossing tour of 2018.\r\n\nTrue to form, Beyoncé issued a surprise live album, the Grammy-winning Homecoming, in April 2019. Paired with a film of the same title, the set documented her 2018 Coachella performance and added a cover of <a href=\"spotify:artist:3DvdryKH4O95ZnsUZJKXpt\">Maze</a>'s \"Before I Let Go.\" Later that year, she not only starred as Nala in the photorealistic remake of The Lion King, but curated the film's accompanying soundtrack, The Lion King: The Gift. Featuring a wealth of African artists collaborating with the likes of co-star <a href=\"spotify:artist:7tlzFDl81KD9RL045ewyIA\">Donald Glover</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB\">Jay-Z</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2RdwBSPQiwcmiDo9kixcl8\">Pharrell Williams</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg\">Kendrick Lamar</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:4lPl9gqgox3JDiaJ1yklKh\">Tierra Whack</a>, the album also included her single \"Spirit,\" which went on to receive both Grammy and Oscar nominations. Beyoncé returned to the top of the Hot 100 in May 2020 as a featured artist on <a href=\"spotify:artist:181bsRPaVXVlUKXrxwZfHK\">Megan Thee Stallion</a>'s \"Savage Remix.\" Only two months later, she was behind the musical film Black Is King, also her third visual album. She took four awards from the subsequent Grammy ceremony: Best R&B Performance (for the Juneteenth charity single \"Black Parade\"), Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance (both for \"Savage\"), and Best Music Video (\"Brown Skin Girl\"). Another soundtrack song, \"Be Alive,\" arrived in May 2021 as part of the tennis biopic King Richard. \r\n\nIn June 2022, Beyoncé released \"Break My Soul,\" a house track made with \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" collaborators <a href=\"spotify:artist:1W3FSF1BLpY3hlVIgvenLz\">the-Dream</a> and Tricky Stewart, as the first single off her seventh studio album. The song reached the Top 20 of the Hot 100 before the late-July arrival of its parent release, Renaissance. A vibrant and uptempo collection inspired in part by post-'70s Black and queer dance music, Renaissance debuted at number one and in early 2023 earned Beyoncé four more Grammy Awards, making her the most awarded artist in the organization's history. Following the triumphant Renaissance World Tour, she released its accompanying documentary concert movie Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé, which she wrote, directed, and produced. A new track, \"My House,\" was released in conjunction.\r\n\nBeyoncé's next era was unveiled in February 2024 during Super Bowl LVIII in the form of singles such as the chart-topping \"Texas Hold 'Em\" -- the first number one on the country chart by a Black woman -- and the sweeping \"16 Carriages,\" from the country-tinged second act of her album trilogy, which she dubbed Cowboy Carter. The expansive 27-song set staked her claim in the genre with the help of guests such as veterans <a href=\"spotify:artist:32vWCbZh0xZ4o9gkz4PsEU\">Dolly Parton</a>, <a href=\"spotify:artist:5W5bDNCqJ1jbCgTxDD0Cb3\">Willie Nelson</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:78adFi9EyRkMh3CTIatrV9\">Linda Martell</a>, while the likes of Tanner Adell, <a href=\"spotify:artist:6YM5gRpMJkP0kUWRcvlHT3\">Brittney Spencer</a>, and <a href=\"spotify:artist:3y2cIKLjiOlp1Np37WiUdH\">Shaboozey</a> represented a younger generation of Black country artists. An intensely personal statement about reclamation, belonging, and legacy, Cowboy Carter entered the pop, country, and folk charts at number one. When the Grammy nominations were announced in late 2024, Beyoncé led the pack with 11 nominations, making her the most nominated artist in show's history. ~ TiVo Staff, Rovi",
